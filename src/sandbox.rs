//! Filesystem sandboxing for read-only command execution.
//!
//! On Linux there are two backends. Bubblewrap (`bwrap --ro-bind /` plus tmpfs masks) is preferred
//! whenever it is installed and its user-namespace smoke test passes; Landlock LSM is the fallback,
//! and requires ABI v3 (kernel 6.2+) because `truncate(2)` is unmediated below it (see
//! `MIN_LANDLOCK_ABI`, which is Linux-only and so deliberately not an intra-doc link: the link
//! would be unresolvable on the two targets where the item does not exist, and CI gates rustdoc on
//! all three). On macOS, uses `sandbox-exec`. On Windows there are two mechanisms rather than one:
//! `read` spawns the child with a duplicated primary token dropped to Low integrity via
//! `SetTokenInformation(TokenIntegrityLevel, …)`, which blocks writes to anything outside the
//! documented Low-integrity surface, while `workspace` uses a `WRITE_RESTRICTED` token plus a
//! per-root capability ACE and deliberately leaves the integrity label alone. On FreeBSD the
//! confinement is a jail built by `jailbrokerd`, a privileged daemon reached over a Unix socket
//! (see `jailbroker`, which is FreeBSD-only and so deliberately not an intra-doc link); meka spawns
//! nothing itself, and a command at `read` or `workspace` runs only while that daemon is listening.
//!
//! **What every backend does not restrict**: reads. A sandboxed child can read any file the user
//! can, including credential files, and the network is deliberately left open on all of them. The
//! boundary these enforce is "this command cannot change the machine", not "this command cannot see
//! or send anything". FreeBSD is the one exception to the first half, and it is the broker's
//! doing rather than a stronger claim here: a jailed command sees the base the operator's prefix
//! policy admits rather than the whole host.

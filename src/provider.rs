//! LLM provider abstraction. Defines the [`Provider`] trait, the shared message/content/tool types,
//! and the [`ProviderBuilder`] that returns a concrete backend.
//!
//! A backend is named for the wire protocol it speaks, not for a vendor or an auth method, because
//! neither of those identifies the request shape: one vendor serves several protocols (OpenAI has
//! both Chat Completions and Responses) and one protocol is served by many vendors (`/v1/messages`
//! by Anthropic, LiteLLM, Databricks, Ollama, …). The two subscription backends carry a vendor name
//! instead, because what they select is a billing relationship whose endpoint and client shape come
//! with it.

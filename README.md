# meka

A general-purpose AI agent harness.

> [!CAUTION]
> Agents can perform potentially destructive actions. Exercise caution when granting a permission level that can modify files or run commands.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> meka is opinionated software and has not stabilized. Defaults, configuration keys, tool names, and stored formats may change between releases. Read the changelog before upgrading.

## Features

- **Scheduling**: the agent wakes itself on a cron, optionally gated on a command or tool call.
- **Proactive context management**: the agent watches its own usage and compacts when it chooses.
- **Memory**: notes the agent keeps, tagged, ranked, and searchable across sessions.
- **Sandboxed shell**: write access confined by the operating system itself.
- **Sub-agents**: the parent seeds one with a skill and can follow up on it later; several run in parallel.
- **Background tasks**: detached tool calls that report back when they finish.
- **Skills**: [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) compliant, portable across clients.
- **MCP**: any standard-compliant server, over streamable HTTP or stdio.
- **Sessions**: resume, fork, rewind, export, or import.

## Supported backends

- **Anthropic Messages**: Anthropic's own API. Also served by Bedrock, LiteLLM, Ollama, and others.
- **OpenAI Chat Completions**: the industry standard. Supported by almost every provider.
- **OpenAI Responses**: OpenAI's agent-oriented interface, recommended for new projects.
- **Claude subscription** / **ChatGPT subscription**: sign in with your subscription plan.
- **OpenCode Go**: OpenCode's subscription, over all three protocols.

## Interfaces

The same agent core is available through several interfaces:

- **CLI**: a REPL, or one-shot commands for scripts.
- **ACP**: runs inside editors like Zed via the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/).
- **HTTP API**: use meka to power your own apps and bots.
- [**mekaweb**](https://github.com/k4yt3x/mekaweb), a web interface, hosted at [web.meka.run](https://web.meka.run).
- [**mekabridge**](https://github.com/k4yt3x/mekabridge) connects the agent to messaging platforms such as Telegram.

## Installation

meka runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Download a pre-built binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/k4yt3x/meka/releases/latest), or install with Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/k4yt3x/meka.git
```

Building from source needs Rust 1.95 or newer and a C toolchain, which `rusqlite` uses to compile the bundled SQLite.

To let the agent do anything short of touching your machine, the [`mekabox`](scripts/mekabox) wrapper runs the installed binary at `unrestricted` inside a disposable `archlinux:latest` container, with your config mounted read-only.

## Quick start

Add an account with `meka account add`, then a profile on it with `meka profile add`. The first runs the OAuth login (or prompts for an API key), saves the secret to the store, and writes the account to `~/.config/meka/config.toml`; the second names the model:

```bash
meka account add anthropic --backend claude-subscription
meka profile add work --account anthropic --model claude-opus-5-5
```

An account is a backend, an endpoint and a login. The backend is either a wire protocol (`anthropic-messages`, `openai-chat-completions`, `openai-responses`) or a product whose endpoint is fixed (`claude-subscription` and `chatgpt-subscription`, which sign in with your subscription; `opencode-go`, `opencode-go-responses` and `opencode-go-messages`, which take an API key). A profile is an account plus a model, so one login can serve several models. Add several and switch with `meka profile use <name>` or `--profile <name>`. For an OpenAI-compatible endpoint like OpenRouter, set `--base-url` on the account:

```bash
meka account add openrouter --backend openai-chat-completions --base-url https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
meka profile add opus --account openrouter --model anthropic/claude-opus-5.5
```

Run `meka` and start typing. Press Shift+Tab to cycle permissions (none, read, workspace, unrestricted):

```console
meka ~/project [r] > find all TODO comments in this project
meka ~/project [u] > install and start nginx
```

See the [documentation](https://docs.meka.run) for the full usage guide.

## Tools

The agent has access to the following built-in tools, grouped by class:

- `shell_execute`: run a shell command and read its output
- `file_*`: read, write, edit, find, and search files
- `web_fetch`: fetch a URL as markdown, raw HTML, or an image
- `scratchpad_*`: session-scoped working memory, kept out of the context window
- `todo_*`: track multi-step work in a task list shown in the terminal
- `memory_*`: keep durable notes that outlive the session
- `conversation_*`: search and re-read this session's full conversation
- `context_*`: measure the live context window, or compact it
- `agent_*`: delegate work to sub-agents and manage them
- `skill_*`: read and search skills, or write and delete them when `agent_managed` is set
- `schedule_*`: run a prompt later, once or repeatedly, optionally behind a gate
- `task_*`: list and cancel background tasks
- `image_render`: view an image from base64 or a scratchpad entry
- `mcp_*`: list, read, and subscribe to MCP resources, and render MCP prompts
- `tool_*`: find a tool by keyword, or load a deferred tool's schema

Run `meka tool list` for the current set with descriptions. Long-output tools take an optional `scratchpad` parameter to save their output there instead of returning it. See the [tool reference](https://docs.meka.run/tools/overview.html).

## Permissions

The prompt indicator shows the current permission level. Press **Shift+Tab** to cycle between levels:

- `[n]` **none**: no tools; the model can only reply with text
- `[r]` **read**: read-only tools, and a shell sandboxed against writes
- `[w]` **workspace**: every tool; writes confined to the cwd and any `--writable-root`
- `[u]` **unrestricted**: every tool, with no boundary on where writes land

A call the level does not cover is refused, or, with `/approvals on`, put to you for approval.

## Sessions

Conversations are persisted in the store, a local SQLite file, and can be resumed:

- `meka -c` continues the last session
- `meka -r <id>` resumes a session by id, or by any unique prefix of one
- `meka session list` / `delete` / `export` manage and export past sessions
- `/compact`, `/fork`, `/rewind`, `/export` act on the current session from the shell

## Shell escape

Prefix input with `!` to execute a command directly, bypassing the LLM:

```console
meka ~/project [r] > !uname -a
meka ~/project [r] > !docker ps
```

Type `/exit`, `/quit`, `exit` or `quit`, or press **Ctrl+D** on an empty line, to leave the shell.

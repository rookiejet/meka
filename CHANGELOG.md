## [Unreleased]

### Added

- FreeBSD: `shell_execute` at `read` and `workspace` runs in a jail `jailbrokerd` builds.
- `[shell].jailbroker_socket` names the socket that daemon listens on.
- Three `opencode-go` backends, one per protocol, for OpenCode Go's subscription.
- OpenCode Go requests carry the required `x-opencode-session` header per conversation.
- `meka account usage` reports an OpenCode Go subscription's dollar-budget windows.

### Fixed

- Builds on FreeBSD.

## [0.61.0] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- `memory_read` accepts a character offset to continue reading long notes.

### Changed

- Agent guidance is shorter and states search limits, image support, and one-shot delivery rules.
- Context summaries prioritize active work, constraints, and commitments over completed history.

### Fixed

- Agents retain live memory, tool, and execution guidance across compaction.
- Sub-agents receive current tool, skill, memory, and permitted MCP server guidance.
- Checkpoints and background notices name only tools that are registered.
- Loading a tool no longer suggests calling one the level refuses.
- Bulk skill updates stay within the same context budget as the initial index.

## [0.60.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- `tool_search` finds a tool by keyword, deferred ones included, and whether your level allows it.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** every built-in is now `<noun>_<verb>`: nine names change; see the upgrade guide.
- **Breaking:** `todo` is now `todo_write`, `todo_edit` and `todo_read`, one operation each.
- Stored sessions, sub-agent restrictions, tasks, job gates and 0.59 archives convert on first open.
- The per-turn deferred-tool listing is bounded, so a large MCP server costs less context.
- `tool_load` suggests the right name for a near miss and lists keyword matches for a bare word.
- `tool_load` says whether your permission level allows a call to the tool it loaded.

### Fixed

- Sub-agents can now find and load the MCP tools they hold; they were never told about them.
- `agent_delete` refuses a sub-agent that is still running instead of deleting it mid-run.
- A turn whose session was deleted while its images decoded is refused instead of running.
- `PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}` naming `cwd` or `profile` holds the session, so no turn starts under it.
- A canceled turn no longer waits for a provider error reply whose body never arrives.
- `web_fetch` stops when the turn is canceled instead of waiting for the server or its timeout.
- `[serve] max_concurrent_turns` now covers inbox, scheduled and background-outcome turns.
- `[schedule] max_jobs` holds under concurrent creates.
- `file_read` past its ceiling keeps a window's leading blank lines and reports the right range.
- `file_read` no longer holds a line larger than its ceiling in memory before refusing it.
- Token usage from a turn's completed rounds is kept when a later round fails or it is canceled.
- `web_fetch`'s `limit` counts characters as documented, not bytes.
- An MCP elicitation is declined, not guessed, when two sessions have calls in flight on one server.

## [0.59.0] - 2026-09-18

### Changed

- **Breaking:** meka is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later; earlier releases stay under MIT.
- **Breaking:** Problem `type` URIs moved to `https://meka.run/errors/`.

## [0.58.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- `[serve] cors_allowed_origins` lets a web application call the API from a listed origin, or any.

## [0.57.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- `GET /v1/info` reports the scopes the calling token holds.
- A feed reader that opens the stream with `attend=true` is asked to approve gated calls.
- The `turn.started` a feed synthesizes for a client attaching mid-turn names the turn's source.
- `tool_call.output_delta` streams a running command's output on the feed ahead of its result.
- `subagent.activity` shows on the parent's feed which tool a sub-agent is running.

### Changed

- `PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}` changes the level and approvals during a turn; `cwd` and `profile` wait.

## [0.56.0] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- `agent_followup`, `agent_steer` and `agent_delete` take any prefix unique among the sub-agents.

### Fixed

- `meka tool list` showed `execute_command` at `unrestricted` where sessions run it at `read`.

## [0.55.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- A session inbox: `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/inbox` hands the agent a message without waiting.
- A `steer` item reaches a running turn at its next round boundary; a `followup` waits for it.
- An `interrupt` item cuts the answer being streamed, keeps what arrived, and the turn carries on.
- An item on an idle session opens a turn of its own; one that keeps failing is dropped in an hour.
- `GET` and `DELETE` on the inbox, `inbox_pending` on the session, `Idempotency-Key` on the row.
- `inbox.delivered`, `inbox.failed` and `inbox.withdrawn` on the feed; the first two as webhooks.
- `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/cancel` takes a `turn_id` and refuses to stop any other turn.
- `agent_steer` sends a sub-agent a message it reads at its next step, or on the next follow-up.
- `agent_steer` takes `interrupt: true` to cut the answer a sub-agent is writing.
- `agent_followup` on a sub-agent still running says so and points at `agent_steer`.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/stream` is the session feed across turns; it no longer ends.
- **Breaking:** a session that has not streamed yet opens its feed instead of answering 404.
- Every SSE event carries `turn_id` and `session_id`; `turn.started` says who started the turn.
- Scheduled fires and background-outcome turns appear on the session feed as they run.
- A session with a live feed subscriber is not evicted for idleness.
- Resuming a session reads only the conversation since its last compaction, so it opens fast.
- The store gains an index on message kinds; the migration runs on open behind the usual backup.

### Fixed

- `openai-chat-completions` dropped user text sent beside tool results; it now follows them.

## [0.54.1] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- `/status` and the usage line report cache hits on the OpenAI backends, which read 0% before.
- A `chatgpt-subscription` conversation hits the prompt cache on every request, not one in four.

## [0.54.0] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- The store's tables, columns and indexes follow one naming rule; the upgrade renames them in place.
- The `provider_credentials` view the 0.46 upgrade left in the store is dropped.
- **Breaking:** a background task reports `tool` and `scratchpad_entry` on the HTTP API and webhook.
- **Breaking:** a memory's creation stamp is `created_at` over HTTP and `created` in an export.
- **Breaking:** a session archive holds `scratchpad_entries`, not `tool_outputs`, as format 3.
- `mekabox` instructs the agent not to create memories or scheduled jobs unless asked.

## [0.53.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- `/status` shows how many times the session has been compacted, in the REPL and under ACP.

### Changed

- Every request carries the whole conversation; the ceiling and compaction are its only bound.
- **Breaking:** `mekabox` lives at `scripts/mekabox`, no longer under `contrib/container/`.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `[session].context_messages` is gone; delete the key or the config is refused.
- **Breaking:** no container image is published anymore; `mekabox` runs the host binary instead.

### Fixed

- A conversation past 200 messages no longer loses its oldest turns without a summary.
- Context usage climbs to the ceiling and compacts instead of falling as history slid out.
- Thinking with no Claude signature is left out of a Claude request instead of sent unsigned.
- The context gauge after a compaction or rewind counts the last request's system prompt and tools.
- The context-overflow error over HTTP and ACP no longer claims a compaction ran when none did.

## [0.52.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- `[session] context_ceiling_percent` sets where auto-compaction fires and whole reads stop.

### Changed

- Auto-compaction fires past 90% of the context window instead of 80%.
- Auto-compaction also runs between two tool rounds of one turn, not only between turns.
- A compaction cuts a turn larger than the verbatim budget at a round, keeping its latest rounds.
- A compaction inside a turn quotes the request being answered after the summary, as written.
- A resumed session checks its first turn against the occupancy last measured, not an estimate.
- A rewind forgets the occupancy the session recorded, so a resume does not compact against it.
- A whole `scratchpad_read` is cut at the context ceiling and says where to continue.
- `context_check` reports headroom to the ceiling, net of what this round's whole reads took.

### Fixed

- A `scratchpad_read` reply is never spilled back into the scratchpad it was read from.

## [0.51.0] - 2026-09-12

### Changed

- A whole reply is never timed out; a dead connection is found by TCP and HTTP/2 keepalives.
- Sub-agents follow their parent's `--no-stream` and `display.stream` setting.

### Fixed

- A reply over five minutes in the making no longer fails a `--no-stream` turn or a compaction.
- Canceling a turn drops a reply the provider is still generating, instead of waiting for it.

## [0.50.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- `meka account list` and `meka profile list` flag an account whose `backend` meka does not know.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `meka tools` is `meka tool`, so the catalog is `meka tool list`.
- **Breaking:** the REPL's `/tasks` is `/task`, with the same `show` and `cancel` forms.
- Every listing fits 120 columns: a name you retype is shown whole; the description takes the rest.
- One vocabulary for listings: `Permission`, `Status`, `Priority`, `yes`/`no`, `enabled`/`disabled`.
- `skill get`, `memory get`, `account whoami` and `stats` print aligned `label: value` lines.
- `meka instructions path` is a `Path`/`Exists` table rather than tab-separated lines.
- Plain listings are for reading; a script should take `--format json`, whose shapes are unchanged.

### Removed

- The tool count `meka mcp tools` printed under its table.

### Fixed

- `/help` keeps every description in one column, whatever the length of a command's argument hint.
- A listing row that ends in an empty cell no longer carries trailing spaces.

## [0.49.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- `[display].show_session_id_on_resume = false` hides the banner a resumed session prints.

### Changed

- A resumed session announces itself as `Resuming session:` rather than `Continuing session:`.

### Removed

- The priority distribution `meka memory list` printed under its table.

## [0.48.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- HTTP turns may withdraw an unanswered message: `options.unanswered_message`, `keep` by default.
- A failed or canceled HTTP turn carries `message_withdrawn`, whether its message is still there.
- `meka account rename` and `meka profile rename` rename in place.

## [0.47.1] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- `agent_spawn` says it refuses a `profile` while the choice is off; otherwise internal cleanups.

## [0.47.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- `[subagents].agent_chosen_profile` lets the spawning agent choose the profile a sub-agent runs on.
- `agent_spawn` takes `profile`, a configured profile the sub-agent runs on and keeps on follow-ups.

### Changed

- `claude-subscription` logs in and refreshes at Claude Code 2.1.263's endpoints, with its scopes.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `search_web` is gone. Add an MCP search server instead; the upgrade guide names one.

## [0.46.1] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- `/status` prints the profile and its account on their own lines, the backend beside the account.
- Falling back to Landlock logs one warning: why, what it gives up, and the pin that silences it.
- The Windows and Landlock ABI warnings are one clause each; the shell page holds the detail.
- A pinned `landlock` sandbox backend no longer warns that it cannot hide meka's store.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- `meka account` (`add`, `login`, `list`, `remove`) manages the accounts that log in and bill.
- `meka profile` (`add`, `set`, `use`, `list`, `remove`) manages the profiles that pick a model.
- `migrate-0.45-to-0.46.py`, a release asset, converts a 0.45 `config.toml`, dry-run by default.
- A profile's `max_request_bytes` caps requests on every backend; old images are redacted to fit.
- `[display].stream` sets whether answers stream; `--no-stream` keeps turning it off for one run.
- `-p -` reads the first turn's prompt from stdin, to end of input.
- `--oneshot --format json` prints the turn as one object: text, tool calls, usage and stop reason.
- `--format json` on every `list` and `show` command, printing the HTTP API's record shapes.
- With `approvals` on, a tool call above the session's level is put to the user instead of refused.
- `[permissions].approvals` is what a new session starts with.
- `/approvals`, `PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}` and the ACP `approvals` option set it for a session.
- The REPL approval prompt takes `always` and `never`, which answer for that tool for the session.
- The HTTP `permission_required` event carries `input`, the call's arguments.
- An HTTP SSE `progress` event relays MCP `notifications/progress` for a running tool.
- A `turn.canceled` event carries `reason: "sse_lag"` when a slow consumer stopped the turn.
- `read_count` on HTTP memory records, and `read_only_hint_declined` on `GET /v1/mcp/{name}/tools`.
- Every HTTP operation's OpenAPI entry names the scopes that admit it and lists its 500 response.
- ACP permission requests carry `rawInput` and a JSON content block with the call's arguments.
- ACP relays compactions, failed scheduled turns and declined elicitations as `[meka]` chunks.
- `scratchpad_merge` takes an optional `prefix` that selects every own entry starting with it.
- `search_contents` takes a `limit` of 1 to 100 matches; a `scratchpad` target still lifts the cap.
- `agent_spawn` takes `writable_roots`, bounding a sub-agent's writes within the parent's reach.
- MCP `initialize` names meka as the client and declares elicitation support to the server.
- Images are stored once, keyed by content hash, and shared across sessions; exports carry them.
- `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/blobs/{hash}` serves a stored image's bytes.
- A store whose tables lag its version is refused, naming the `-wal` file a copy may have left.
- Cargo features: `serve` (default) for the HTTP API, `mock-provider` for the test provider.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `[providers.<name>]` splits into `[accounts.<name>]` and `[profiles.<name>]`.
- **Breaking:** `default_provider` is `default_profile`.
- **Breaking:** a 0.45 `config.toml` is refused at startup until the script converts it.
- **Breaking:** config durations are strings like `"30d"`; `_seconds` and `_days` keys are gone.
- **Breaking:** `[mcp].strict` is `default_required` and `[thinking].budget_tokens` is `budget`.
- **Breaking:** `redact_thinking` is `thinking_display`, one of `updates`, `summarized`, `redacted`.
- **Breaking:** `MEKA_MCP_STDIO_CONCURRENCY` and `MEKA_MCP_HTTP_CONCURRENCY` are gone.
- `[mcp].stdio_concurrency` (3) and `[mcp].http_concurrency` (20) replace them; zero is refused.
- **Breaking:** `MEKA_MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` takes a duration such as `10m`, not milliseconds.
- **Breaking:** an unknown permission level in `config.toml` is a parse error, not a warning.
- `meka profile add` no longer sets `default_profile`; a lone profile is the default.
- `meka profile set` refuses a thinking key on a backend without thinking.
- `client_id` and `oauth_token_url` are omitted on a backend that ignores them, and warn if set.
- A `chatgpt-subscription` `base_url` must be an origin or end in `/backend-api/codex`.
- **Breaking:** the prompt is `-p, --prompt`; there is no positional prompt.
- **Breaking:** `--provider` is `--profile`, long form only; `-p` is the prompt.
- **Breaking:** flag values such as `--permission read` and `--format json` refuse case variants.
- **Breaking:** `mcp add --auth` takes `oauth`, `client_credentials` or `client_credentials_jwt`.
- Markdown exports separate a user's words from an image placeholder and mark a wordless turn.
- `meka account login` and `meka mcp login` print the OAuth URL instead of opening a browser.
- `meka session show` labels the title `title` (was `opening`).
- `meka session export` writes the file atomically and owner-only, as `memory export` does.
- An empty listing says `No <nouns>.` on stderr; the `show` commands align their fields alike.
- **Breaking:** tool calls show their real names (`read_file`, not `ReadFile`) on every surface.
- Refusals read the same on every host, e.g. `no profile named 'x' (configured: a, b)`.
- Messages use American spelling and quote names in single quotes, keys and commands in backticks.
- Timestamps print in local time with the UTC offset; listings no longer print unlabeled UTC.
- Sizes in tool results, notices and `/status` print as MiB, KiB or B to one decimal.
- Lost writes, failed sandbox restrictions and capture fallbacks warn instead of logging at debug.
- The REPL's approval prompt is headed `[approval]` instead of `[ask]`, matching the switch.
- The read-mode sandbox hides meka's own directories; Landlock and Windows warn that they cannot.
- `write_file` and `edit_file` refuse a target inside meka's own directories at `workspace`.
- Reads, searches and `scratchpad_load_file` refuse meka's own directories below `unrestricted`.
- **Breaking:** `/provider` is `/profile`.
- REPL notices are colored by level, and the REPL echoes a scheduled job's prompt before its reply.
- Every REPL slash command prints to stderr, like `/status`; the model's answers stay on stdout.
- **Breaking:** `provider` is `profile` on `POST`, `PATCH` and every response of `/v1/sessions`.
- **Breaking:** `GET /v1/providers` is `GET /v1/profiles`; rows carry `account` and `backend`.
- **Breaking:** `GET /v1/health/ready` reports `profile_configured` (was `provider_configured`).
- **Breaking:** a stopped turn's SSE terminal event is `turn.canceled` (`/errors/turn-canceled`).
- An HTTP permission request stays answerable for 30 minutes (was 60 seconds), as on ACP.
- Every optional HTTP API field is omitted when absent, never `null`; `display_summary` included.
- A request body that fails to parse is answered `invalid <endpoint> request body: <diagnostic>`.
- `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/turn` with `options.skill` and an empty `message` runs the skill alone.
- Answering a permission request on a session not in memory is 404 instead of loading the session.
- `[serve].relay_provider_errors` governs `meka acp` as well as the HTTP API.
- **Breaking:** ACP's `provider` config option is `profile`.
- **Breaking:** a refusal the ACP caller can act on answers `InvalidParams`, not `InternalError`.
- **Breaking:** ACP `session/set_config_option` refuses a profile switch while a turn is in flight.
- **Breaking:** ACP tool call and permission titles read `<tool name> <argument>`.
- An ACP prompt refused because the session is busy says what holds it and to retry.
- **Breaking:** `conversation_search` takes `is_regex` (was `regex`).
- **Breaking:** `conversation_read` takes `limit` (was `count`).
- **Breaking:** `find_files` takes `glob` (was `pattern`).
- **Breaking:** `fetch_url` takes `limit` (was `max_length`).
- **Breaking:** `agent_followup` and `agent_delete` name the sub-agent by `id` (was `agent`).
- The `todo` tool writes `canceled` and still accepts `cancelled`.
- **Breaking:** a scheduled job runs at its session's level, never at the host's `--permission`.
- **Breaking:** a gate's `is` test is spelled `not_empty` (was `not-empty`); stored jobs convert.
- A `schedule.fired` webhook reports a stopped turn as `canceled`, not `failed`.
- `meka schedule show` reports a job whose session's level is disabled as withheld, not as unknown.
- A scheduled fire that finds its session busy waits for the next sweep, on every host alike.
- A gate may call a tool that needs `read` or less, not only one that needs exactly `read`.
- Only `meka mcp login` runs the OAuth flow; a host marks a server with no credential as failed.
- `anthropic-messages` sends no one-hour cache TTL or beta; `claude-subscription` keeps both.
- `claude-subscription` matches Claude Code 2.1.263.
- **Breaking:** an image block in session messages and exports carries a `hash`, not its bytes.
- **Breaking:** per-turn context is a typed `turn_context` block ahead of a user message's `text`.
- **Breaking:** a session export archive names its `profile`, and its `format_version` is 2.
- **Breaking:** a stopped background task's `status` is `canceled`, stored rows included.
- A session that recorded no level adopts `[permissions].default` when the store migrates.
- The session title is the first user words, cut at 80 characters, everywhere it appears.
- A session's `cwd` and the `cwd` listing filter are both canonicalized, on every host.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `meka provider`; `meka account` and `meka profile` replace it.
- **Breaking:** the positional profile on `account usage`, `whoami` and `stats`; use `--profile`.
- **Breaking:** the one-letter levels (`n`, `r`, `w`, `u`) on `--permission` and `MEKA_PERMISSION`.
- **Breaking:** the aliases `rich` (`termimad`), `text` (`--format plain`) and `md` (`markdown`).
- **Breaking:** the `ask` permission level; an `ask` session migrates to `none` with approvals on.

### Fixed

- `mcp list`, `account list` and `memory list` put notes on stderr, so stdout is only the table.
- `meka account add --api-key-stdin` refuses an empty stdin by name, as `mcp add` does.
- `meka account` reports a failure like every other command instead of exiting mid-run.
- `meka profile add` cannot overwrite a profile another process added meanwhile.
- `meka memory edit` and `meka skill add --edit` help name `$VISUAL`, then `$EDITOR`, as tried.
- A failed one-shot turn waits for a command it detached instead of leaving the child untracked.
- Command-output captures that fall back to the temp directory are swept there too.
- A tool call nobody can approve is denied and named on every host, not reported as canceled.
- A detached call that would be refused anyway is no longer put to the user for approval first.
- `always` and `never` approval answers survived `/fork`; the copy starts with nothing remembered.
- Ctrl+C at the REPL approval prompt cancels it, and a bare Enter afterward no longer approves.
- A session whose recorded level is disabled warns and starts at the default, on every host.
- `--permission` on a resume that fails to start leaves the session's recorded level as it was.
- `/rewind` with an argument that is not a count says so, instead of rewinding one turn.
- `/clear` clears the terminal on stderr, so a redirected stdout no longer receives the escapes.
- A Ctrl+C between turns no longer counts as the second press that stops background tasks.
- `/mcp reconnect` without a server name says so instead of reporting an unknown command.
- A Ctrl+C during `/compact` prints `(interrupted)` instead of an error.
- `/status` counts image redactions, checkpoints and summaries included; it always showed none.
- A line padded with zero-width characters no longer holds the REPL for minutes while wrapping.
- Wrapping a tool argument to one or two rows produced one row more than the budget allowed.
- A log line relayed to the REPL never blocks, which could hang the shell.
- Ctrl+C while a turn waits for MCP servers cancels the turn instead of being lost.
- The Windows sandbox warning says a workspace root above meka's directories can write them.
- **Breaking:** a `[web]` or `base_url` misconfiguration answers a sanitized 500, not a 422.
- **Breaking:** a session lock meka cannot open answers 500, not a 409 blaming another process.
- **Breaking:** meka's own request-ceiling refusal is 422 `request-too-large`, not 502 `provider`.
- **Breaking:** `GET`/`PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}` answer 404 or 500, never 200 with `profile: ""`.
- **Breaking:** `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/schedule` with scheduling disabled answers 404, not 422.
- `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/messages` shows a repaired image or tool result as the model sees it.
- `DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}` refuses a session another meka process holds with 409, not a delete.
- `GET /v1/sessions?limit=0` returns one session rather than an empty page with no cursor.
- A permission answer at a sub-agent's id is 422 `session-not-drivable`, as documented, not 404.
- An empty or malformed turn body on a busy session is refused as 422 rather than 409.
- A retry of a long turn is told its request is in flight instead of getting `turn-in-flight`.
- A session response omits `permission` for a row with no level, as documented, not `""`.
- SSE lag is typed `sse-lag` with `level` and `text`; `stream-detached` carries `turn_id`.
- HTTP skill refusals name the skill and keep the skills directory path out of the body.
- A `[web]` client meka cannot build fails startup on every host, not the first turn of a session.
- `[web].ca_cert_file` goes through `~` expansion like every other path setting.
- Opening a store another process holds no longer stalls the server's other requests.
- ACP `session/new` deletes the row it created when the session cannot be built or locked.
- ACP `session/new`, `load`, `resume` and `fork` refuse a `cwd` that is not an existing directory.
- ACP `session/load` and `resume` no longer rewrite a session's `cwd` and roots before refusing it.
- ACP no longer puts provider bodies, MCP reasons or store paths in a failed turn's `error.data`.
- ACP `session/close` cancels the session's detached tool calls, as the HTTP delete already did.
- The ACP shutdown drain cancels a prompt admitted but not yet published.
- An image on an ACP prompt is judged against the session's profile, not the process default.
- `edit_file` refuses an empty `old_string`; with `replace_all` it rewrote the whole file.
- `scratchpad_save_file` refuses an existing file without `force`; its description said otherwise.
- `scratchpad_save_file` refuses a target it cannot stat instead of overwriting it as absent.
- `scratchpad_read` documents `offset` and `limit` as bytes, snapped to character boundaries.
- `search_contents` counts files it could not read in its "skipped" note.
- `todo` accepts the universal `scratchpad` parameter instead of refusing the call.
- `context_compact` cannot be detached with `background: true`; it fired against a later turn.
- A memory or skill name under 64 characters but over 64 bytes was refused for its length in bytes.
- A sub-agent's `scratchpad` parameter refuses an inherited entry's name instead of shadowing it.
- `agent_spawn` refuses mistyped restrictions rather than spawning an unrestricted sub-agent.
- `agent_spawn` with `scratchpad: null` keeps the sub-agent id in its result.
- A refused `agent_followup` no longer leaves the sub-agent on the new profile.
- A sub-agent spawned while its parent auto-compacts no longer switches the parent's thinking off.
- A sub-agent's activity line no longer goes blank for the rest of the run after an internal error.
- A scheduled gate honors a live session's level even when the level's row write failed.
- A session row the scheduler cannot read grants nothing; it fell back to the host's level.
- A scheduled job whose gate tool or session is unreachable keeps its occurrence for a later sweep.
- A scheduled fire or outcome delivery that reaches a closed session is deferred, not run.
- A scheduled fire cut short by the shutdown drain is deferred without a `failed` webhook first.
- A cancel that lands as a compaction, scheduled fire or outcome delivery starts is honored.
- A delivery webhook's veto on outcomes riding a scheduled fire is logged instead of discarded.
- A gate's shell probe stops at the parse limit instead of buffering everything until its timeout.
- A gate whose stderr exceeds the cap is drained instead of dying on `SIGPIPE` before it answers.
- `meka schedule list --session` reports an unknown session id as such, not as a config error.
- An MCP server whose `headers` or `env` name an unset variable is refused, not sent `${VAR}`.
- An MCP server with stored credentials no longer fails because the OAuth callback port is busy.
- A failed `meka mcp login` restores the credential it replaced.
- A pasted OAuth callback URL decodes form encoding like the listener does.
- `meka mcp add --eager-load-tool` reaches `config.toml`; it was accepted, reported, and dropped.
- An MCP elicitation declined for want of a prompt was only logged; every host now raises a notice.
- An MCP tool called during a compaction sends its progress and elicitations to the right session.
- `openai-chat-completions` sends `max_completion_tokens` from the profile only, never a guess.
- A Chat Completions `error` mid-stream fails the turn instead of committing the partial answer.
- A Chat Completions tool call whose id arrives late is kept, and tool messages drop `is_error`.
- A Chat Completions stream closing after `finish_reason` without `[DONE]` completes, not fails.
- A mid-stream error with a numeric `code` is retried as that status; `"error": null` is benign.
- A Responses `error` frame ends the turn with its reason instead of retrying as truncated.
- A non-streaming Responses answer cut by `max_output_tokens` is kept with its usage, not lost.
- An Anthropic-protocol gateway sending `data:` frames without `event:` lines is read, not retried.
- The cache breakpoint lands on the last block actually sent, after trailing thinking is stripped.
- A `chatgpt-subscription` turn sent two `Content-Type` headers, which the backend refused.
- A ChatGPT subscription refresh that returns no id token keeps the account id it already had.
- A ChatGPT subscription `base_url` whose host name contains `codex` is routed by its path.
- `meka account usage` with a `base_url` ending in `/backend-api/codex` finds the usage endpoints.
- A rejected subscription token gets one refresh and retry before `meka account login` is named.
- Two requests refused with one subscription token share a refresh; the second no longer fails.
- A failed credential save no longer spends a retired refresh token an hour later.
- A stored subscription credential stays refreshable after an upgrade changes the stored shape.
- A `claude-subscription` device id is resolved at startup; the first request could block on it.
- An image the request budget redacts stays redacted, so later requests keep the cache prefix.
- A request still over the ceiling after redaction drops attachments and retries; it used to fail.
- The text that streamed before a connection died is kept in the conversation and the store.
- A partial answer kept after a mid-stream failure is stored after its prompt, not before it.
- A thinking-only round shows its reasoning under `--no-stream`, as it does when streaming.
- A tool round whose save fails keeps its results in the conversation and warns the store lags.
- A compaction after a repaired resume no longer leaves the first messages above the summary.
- A compaction inside a turn no longer writes the prompt twice.
- A conversation of four messages or fewer keeps its unanswered prompt verbatim when compacted.
- An automatic compaction canceled before summarizing no longer pays for a summary it discards.
- A permission level lowered during a checkpoint compaction stops its next tool call.
- A refused prompt no longer swallows background task reports; they ride the next admitted turn.
- A background task whose outcome write fails is retried once, then marked `failed`, not `running`.
- `meka -r <id>` under `[session].retention` no longer deletes the session it was asked to resume.
- A session resumed while the retention sweep runs survives it.
- HTTP and ACP forks refuse a source another process holds, or one mid-turn, instead of copying it.
- A failed fork or export leaves no lock file behind, and a fork that cannot be read back fails.
- An HTTP fork cannot lose its copy to a concurrent `meka session delete --all`.
- `meka serve` and `meka acp` keep statistics per session, so a resume continues its totals.
- Atomic writes sync the parent directory after the rename, so a crash cannot lose the new file.
- An interrupted one-shot run exits 130 instead of 0; `--format json` still prints its report.

## [0.45.1] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Canceling a turn in Zed or another ACP editor no longer cancels the next prompt you submit.
- A stop in an ACP editor with nothing to stop is discarded, rather than canceling a later prompt.

## [0.45.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- `meka session show <id>` prints one session in full, including its whole id.
- `meka schedule show <id>` prints one job untruncated: full prompt, gate command, and session.
- `/tasks show <id>` prints one background task in full, including its whole id and outcome.
- `/schedule show <id>` prints one job in full, so a gate reads without leaving the REPL.
- `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/tasks` reports `announced_at`, absent when nobody has been told yet.

### Changed

- Every command taking a session, job or task id accepts any unique prefix of one.
- Listings shorten an id to what distinguishes it on screen; each `show` prints it in full.
- `meka schedule list` names the session each job wakes, and fits 120 columns instead of 186.
- `meka schedule list` shows how long until a job next fires, rather than an absolute timestamp.
- `meka session list` fits 120 columns instead of 158, spending the width on a longer preview.
- `/tasks` fits 120 columns instead of ~138, bounding the tool name and elapsed time.
- Canceling a background task costs no turn; its report rides your next turn or a job's.
- Under `[thinking].show_content`, reasoning streams as it arrives instead of landing in one lump.
- Reasoning follows `display.render_mode`, in dark gray throughout, so emphasis shows as bold.
- The one-line thinking preview styles its markdown too, rather than printing the markers.
- A shown thinking block has no height limit; asking to see the reasoning asks to see all of it.
- Showing reasoning costs a turn its retry on a transient failure, rather than sending it twice.
- **Breaking:** SSE `thinking.delta` sends one chunk per event; concatenate them for the block.
- **Breaking:** `meka session delete` refuses ids given with `--all`, as `--older-than-days` does.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** the `silent` render mode, which suppressed the answer and kept every bit of chrome.
- `meka schedule list` drops its `When`, `Check` and `Held` columns; `schedule show` carries them.

### Fixed

- A turn that did not stream now shows its reasoning; `--no-stream` displayed none at all.
- A block ending on a paragraph break no longer doubles the blank line before whatever follows it.
- No meka command panics when the reader stops reading; `meka … | head` exits cleanly throughout.
- A stdout that cannot take the output fails the command; a reader that hung up does not.
- meka prints no blank line against your shell prompt, above its first line or below its last.
- `Leaving session:` and the background-task notice below it are no longer split by a blank line.
- `task.finished` fires when a task ends, so an interrupted one is announced even if unreported.
- An empty id prefix matches nothing, instead of canceling the only job or task in the session.
- An uppercase id prefix resolves a job or task, as it already resolved a session.
- A background outcome is no longer discarded unread when the turn that would report it cannot run.
- `meka session delete` exits non-zero when a session it was asked to delete was not deleted.

### Security

- `meka session list` sanitizes its preview and timestamp cells, which reached the terminal raw.
- `/tasks` sanitizes the command line and result excerpt it renders, which were passed through raw.
- `meka mcp tools` sanitizes the server-chosen tool name, which reached the terminal raw.

## [0.44.4] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- Editing config locks the config directory, so no `.config.toml.lock` is written on Unix.
- A skill store is claimed by locking its directory, so no `.meka-store.lock` is written on Unix.
- File locks use `std::fs::File`, so meka no longer depends on `fd-lock` directly.

## [0.44.3] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- `context_compact` runs before the next step, so the turn that asked continues on the summary.
- A turn acts on one `context_compact` request; a second in the same turn is ignored.

### Fixed

- Stopping a turn stops a compaction it asked for, instead of replacing the window regardless.
- An interrupt during an emergency compaction is reported as a stop, not a context overflow.

## [0.44.2] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- A store meka refuses to migrate is named by path, instead of an unlocatable "this store".
- `failed to open database` and `failed to initialize schema` name the store they are about.

## [0.44.1] - 2026-08-31

### Removed

- The compat error for `meka -c <uuid>`, retired in 0.37.0; the id now reads as a prompt.

### Fixed

- A thinking signature sent on `content_block_start` is kept, unbreaking tool calls via OpenRouter.
- `newline_after_prompt` now also separates the `Continuing session:` banner from replayed history.

## [0.44.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- A session records the provider profile it runs on; resume, export and import all restore it.
- A session's context window, vision flag and `max_output_tokens` come from its own profile.
- `meka provider set <name> <key> <value>` edits one profile setting, leaving the rest intact.
- `provider add` gains flags for every remaining profile field, so any profile is one command.
- `/provider`, `PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}` and ACP `set_config_option` move a session's profile.
- `POST /v1/sessions` takes `provider`; session bodies and `meka session list` report it.
- `meka provider login --api-key-stdin` rotates an API key without rebuilding the profile.
- `meka mcp login --auth-token-stdin` / `--client-secret-stdin` set or rotate a server's secret.
- `meka mcp get` reports which credentials a server holds and the host its OAuth grant names.
- `[serve] relay_provider_errors` controls whether a 502 carries the provider's error text.
- New problem types: `/errors/provider-unavailable` and `/errors/session-not-drivable`.
- A turn whose repair did not help points at `/rewind` before it fails.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** a run selects a profile with `--provider`; nothing overrides a field inside one.
- **Breaking:** the REPL and `--oneshot` resume at the session's recorded permission level.
- **Breaking:** `meka acp` and `meka serve` refuse `-c` and `-r`, which name one run's session.
- **Breaking:** a sub-agent's conversation is driven only by `agent_followup`, never by a host.
- **Breaking:** resume, load, fork and PATCH refuse a sub-agent on every host, before it writes.
- **Breaking:** a fork of a sub-agent is a sibling under the same parent, not a new root.
- **Breaking:** a session carrying spawn terms is refused even when its parent did not survive.
- **Breaking:** a scheduled job is refused on a sub-agent session, naming the one to use instead.
- **Breaking:** `isolated` scheduled jobs are gone; every job fires in the session that created it.
- **Breaking:** MCP `auth_token` and `client_secret` move out of `config.toml` into the database.
- **Breaking:** `meka mcp add` drops `--auth-token` and `--client-secret`; use the `-stdin` forms.
- **Breaking:** `meka mcp logout` clears every stored credential, not only the OAuth tokens.
- **Breaking:** `GET /v1/info` drops `provider` and `model`; `GET /v1/providers` reports both.
- **Breaking:** a 502 carries the provider's response as `provider_response`, formerly withheld.
- **Breaking:** a pre-migration backup supersedes the previous one; the copy 0.43 left is deleted.
- **Breaking:** `/cd` with no argument returns to meka's launch directory, not `$HOME`.
- A session whose recorded profile is not configured is refused by name, never silently redirected.
- A profile's credential is checked when a session first needs it, not when a host starts up.
- Existing sessions adopt `default_provider` when the store is brought forward.
- `--provider` and `--permission` on a resume repin the session.
- `provider add` and `set` refuse a setting the backend never sends, instead of writing it.
- `thinking_budget` is per profile; `[thinking].budget_tokens` remains the fallback.
- Profile keys have one canonical order, shared by the config file, `-h` and the docs.
- `meka provider remove` warns when it clears `default_provider` and how many sessions it strands.
- `meka provider list` flags an unresolvable `default_provider` and a credential it cannot read.
- `meka session import` refuses an archive with no profile when nothing can supply one.
- `meka -c` resumes the newest top-level session, skipping a sub-agent that ran more recently.
- `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/rewind` works on a sub-agent and on a dormant session.
- `GET /v1/health/ready` reports a provider as configured when any profile is.
- A stored MCP bearer and an `[auth]` block are mutually exclusive; the block wins.
- `meka mcp add` refuses a name that still holds a credential, rather than reusing it.
- A failing provider call is attempted three times rather than four, with 1s then 2s of backoff.
- A provider's `Retry-After` is honored up to 60 seconds, where it was capped at 15.
- A 502 from `meka serve` relays the upstream's `Retry-After`, capped at an hour.
- Notes meka writes into a conversation are prefixed `[meka harness]`, not `[meka]`.
- `/provider` lists one profile per line with its backend; `/status` follows the config's order.
- An MCP meta-tool's indicator names the resource or prompt it acts on, not the server.
- Ctrl+C and background-task notices read as annotations: `(interrupted)`, in yellow.
- Warnings and refusals state the outcome and the remedy, without the mechanism behind them.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `--model`, `--base-url`, `--thinking` and `--thinking-budget`.
- **Breaking:** `meka session list --long`, along with the columns it showed.

### Fixed

- A provider call that got no usable response is retried with backoff instead of ending the turn.
- A 429 or 5xx from an OAuth token endpoint is retried instead of killing the turn in progress.
- A 5xx or 429 whose body mentions the context window is retried, not treated as an overflow.
- A 5xx that outlives every retry re-sends unchanged, then degrades the turn's content.
- A retry sequence starts no new attempt after five minutes, so a hung call is not tried again.
- A `Retry-After` the provider gave is no longer discarded when reading its response body fails.
- A 400 from a usage or history probe no longer classifies as a malformed turn.
- `meka serve` answers 502 rather than 500 for a retryable, mid-stream or overflow failure.
- A context overflow answers `/errors/context-overflow`; a client stops retrying what cannot fit.
- `meka serve` answers 503 `/errors/mcp-unavailable`, not 500, when a required MCP server is down.
- An image whose bytes do not decode is refused when read, not sent for the provider to choke on.
- A truncated or corrupt JPEG is refused; the shared decoder accepted one cut to a tenth.
- A too-large image says so when converting, rather than reporting itself as corrupt.
- A refused text-only tool exchange is emptied in place; it used to break every later turn.
- A failed emergency compaction restores the degraded content instead of stranding it.
- Compaction retries a transient provider failure instead of reporting it as a context overflow.
- Ctrl+C ends a compaction waiting to retry, rather than sitting out the provider's `Retry-After`.
- The degrade notice names `meka session export --format json`, which still holds what it removed.
- A degraded tool result carries the flag the call reported, instead of always claiming success.
- A provider's rejection text cannot forge `[meka harness]` inside the note that carries it.
- `meka provider add` destroyed every profile when `providers` was written as an inline table.
- `provider add` wrote a negative integer for a setting above `i64::MAX`, making config unreadable.
- `provider add --client-id` minted the grant as the default client, so refresh always failed.
- The OpenAI API-key backends took an OAuth token they could never refresh, failing at its expiry.
- The OAuth mint posts to the profile's `oauth_token_url`; only refreshes honored it before.
- A rejected OAuth refresh names the profile to run `meka provider login` on.
- `--api-key-stdin` no longer lets a prompt eat the piped key, and is refused for browser logins.
- A resume is no longer blocked by an ambiguous `default_provider` it does not use.
- A rotated provider credential reaches a running `meka serve` instead of being ignored until exit.
- `PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}` naming the recorded profile re-syncs a diverged live agent.
- `agent_followup` records the profile its worker was built on, so its row stops naming another.
- A sub-agent spawned during an ACP mid-turn repin recorded a profile it was not running on.
- Spawning a sub-agent of a session that no longer exists returned an id with no row behind it.
- A write aimed at a sub-agent is refused before its lock is taken, so it cannot answer 409.
- `session import` and `session fork` stop printing a `meka -r` that is refused when run.
- `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/schedule` refuses an imported worker instead of failing on every fire.
- A scheduled job can always cancel itself from the turn it wakes; an isolated fire could not.
- A broken scheduled gate stops being reported once another host has evaluated it successfully.
- An MCP reconnect re-lists tools and re-reads instructions, instead of keeping the old set.
- `meka serve` and `meka acp` defer MCP tool schemas; both shipped every one on every request.
- The REPL's `/skill` completion follows skills the agent adds or deletes mid-session.
- `/cd` records the working directory on the session row, and a resume reopens there.
- `[display]` blank lines bracket everything between two prompts: failures, slash commands, wakes.
- `newline_after_prompt = false` is no longer ignored from the second turn onward.
- A failed turn's partial answer prints in its own turn, not under the next prompt.
- A second Ctrl+C and mid-turn log lines print through the console, not onto the thinking row.
- `/history` replays a built-in's argument; nineteen of them replayed as a bare tool name.
- `context_compact`'s indicator shows its instructions, where it showed no argument.
- `meka tools list` shows the `agent_*` family as rows, replacing a note that named wrong keys.
- A failed migration keeps the pre-migration copy it was about to supersede.
- A store a 0.44 dev build renumbered past `mcp_credentials` has the table restored on next open.

## [0.43.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- A scheduled job's gate can call a read-only tool, MCP or built-in, instead of a shell command.
- Gate conditions `matches` (regex) and `at` (a JSON pointer, tested empty / not-empty / changed).
- A job that cannot fire is marked and explained on every listing, `GET /v1/schedule` included.
- The agent is told when a job stops being able to fire, or becomes able to again.
- `[schedule] claim_lease` sets how long a host's claim on a due occurrence is good for.
- meka migrates its own store on open, in one transaction; no upgrade from 0.42 on needs a script.
- An existing store is copied beside itself before a migration touches it, and the copy is kept.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** a gate is now `check` plus `when`; `command` and `fire` are gone (see Upgrading).
- **Breaking:** `GET /v1/schedule` renders a gate as `check`/`kind`/`when`, not `command`/`fire`.
- **Breaking:** a due job is leased rather than consumed, adding three `scheduled_jobs` columns.
- A store from an older release than 0.42, or from a newer meka, is refused by name and left alone.
- A tool gate is authorized at the tool's own level, so gating no longer demands `unrestricted`.
- A gate's authority is re-resolved at fire time, tool level included, not trusted from creation.
- A gate refused for an unknown or non-read-only tool is a 422, not a 403; no token or level helps.
- `schedule_list` shows a tool gate's arguments and its kind; other listings show the kind only.
- A session at `none` accepts no new scheduled job over HTTP, since none of them could ever fire.
- A job whose delivery fails three times is parked and reported, instead of retried forever.
- A new meka icon replaces the old one for agsh.

### Fixed

- A session at `none` no longer fires scheduled jobs; the woken turn could not act or cancel.
- A one-shot job held back for permission is kept, not deleted; its gate was never evaluated.
- Canceling a job a sweep removed first reports a miss; both doors used to report success.
- A host that crashes mid-delivery no longer loses the occurrence, or for a one-shot the whole job.
- A cancellation issued while a job is delivered is no longer undone when the host hands back.
- `meka schedule list` no longer lets a job's prompt carry a terminal escape into the table.

## [0.42.2] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Docs and HTTP auto-deny notices still named `write`, the permission mode retired in 0.42.0.

## [0.42.1] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Tool descriptions, per-turn context and CLI output are shorter; `-h` fits 80 columns again.

### Removed

- The dedicated message for the retired `write` permission mode; it reads as any unknown mode.
- The startup warning naming memory files left behind in the config directory.

### Fixed

- The agent no longer tells a chat or API user to press Shift+Tab; refusals name the level only.
- `/help` named a permission mode that does not exist and omitted two that do.
- Docs misstated permission modes, serve scopes, scratchpad tools, provider headers and defaults.
- Docs understated the read-mode environment allow-list, which passes TLS-trust variables.

## [0.42.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- `workspace` permission: writes confined to the workspace roots, reads still unrestricted.
- `--writable-root <PATH>` adds a directory to the workspace, repeatable; no config key.
- Windows confines the shell at `workspace` with a restricted token and ACEs released on exit.
- A workspace root at or above a masked directory (`/tmp`, `/run`) is refused with a warning.
- Memory search is ranked and tiered: several phrasings at once, word endings, typos, CJK.
- Memories take tags, a stamped `recorded` date, and render priority-0 bodies in full each turn.
- `meka memory export`, `edit`, `verify` and `add --tag` manage the store by hand.
- Memory files left in the config directory are reported at startup, naming the importer.
- `skill_search` greps every installed skill; `skill_write` / `skill_delete` let the agent author.
- `[skills].extra_paths` scans further directories for skills, read-only and never created.
- Skills read the spec's `license`, `compatibility` and `allowed-tools`, and keep every other key.
- Compaction runs a checkpoint turn first, so the agent saves what must outlast the summary.
- `/compact <instructions>`, `context_check` and `context_compact` steer and inspect compaction.
- `openai-responses`, a backend for the OpenAI Responses API, authenticated with an API key.
- `[providers.<name>].thinking` picks the wire encoding: `adaptive`, `budgeted`, or `off`.
- HTTP: compact, rewind, export and import sessions, and report context occupancy.
- HTTP: manage scheduled jobs, background tasks, skills and memory, behind four new scopes.
- HTTP: rejoin a turn's SSE stream with `Last-Event-ID`, and see compaction as it happens.
- `[[serve.webhooks]]` posts signed, content-free notifications for turns, tasks and jobs.
- `trust_read_only_hint` refuses an MCP server's `readOnlyHint`, keeping the tool out of read mode.
- `meka mcp add --auth-token-stdin` / `--client-secret-stdin` keep secrets out of `ps` and history.
- `[display].tool_params` and `[display].max_width` control tool-call and terminal rendering.
- `[schedule].max_consecutive_fires` interleaves one session's due backlog with other sessions'.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** permission `write` is retired; use `workspace` (confined) or `unrestricted`.
- **Breaking:** `workspace` is enabled by default, so Shift+Tab reaches it before `unrestricted`.
- **Breaking:** ACP `additionalDirectories` and `--writable-root` are writable at `workspace`.
- **Breaking:** `ask` runs the shell unsandboxed and unscrubbed: writes anywhere, full environment.
- **Breaking:** a gate needs `unrestricted`; `workspace` used to authorize one and no longer does.
- **Breaking:** `[shell].sandbox = false` now refuses the shell rather than unconfining it.
- **Breaking:** Landlock requires ABI v3; below it `truncate(2)` was unmediated. Use Bubblewrap.
- **Breaking:** `every = "..."` fires on its own grid; jobs that silently ran slow now run on time.
- **Breaking:** memories are rows in the database under `MEKA_DATA_DIR`, not files in the config.
- **Breaking:** a config-directory backup no longer captures memories; back up the data dir.
- **Breaking:** `memory_search` takes `queries` (a list) instead of `pattern`, and drops regex.
- **Breaking:** `GET /v1/memory` carries `recorded_at` and `tags`, drops `skipped`, 404s cleanly.
- **Breaking:** a written `SKILL.md` conforms to the Agent Skills spec: `name`, then `metadata`.
- **Breaking:** a skill name must follow the spec and match its directory, or it is skipped.
- **Breaking:** the `skill` tool is now `skill_read`; config entries naming `skill` go stale.
- **Breaking:** `meka skill add` swaps `--version` and `--author` for a repeatable `--metadata`.
- **Breaking:** `meka skill add --from-file` needs the `name` the spec makes mandatory.
- **Breaking:** `meka skill get` and `list` change columns; `get` prints every `metadata` key.
- **Breaking:** `claude-api` → `anthropic-messages`, `claude-oauth` → `claude-subscription`.
- **Breaking:** `openai-api` → `openai-chat-completions`, `openai-codex` → `chatgpt-subscription`.
- **Breaking:** HTTP `GET /v1/providers` reports the new backend names in each profile's `type`.
- **Breaking:** `[thinking].enabled` is retired; the per-profile `thinking` mode replaces it.
- **Breaking:** pre-4.6 Claude profiles need `thinking = "budgeted"`; the default is now adaptive.
- **Breaking:** `--thinking` takes `adaptive`, `budgeted` or `off` rather than a boolean.
- **Breaking:** unset `effort` sends no tier, so the provider's own default applies.
- **Breaking:** an unset context window is 1000000, not a guess from the model name.
- **Breaking:** `claude-subscription` matches Claude Code 2.1.241; unset `effort` now sends `high`.
- **Breaking:** a stdio MCP server gets a curated environment; declare its secrets in `env`.
- **Breaking:** deleting a session another meka process has open is refused, not silently done.
- **Breaking:** ACP's sticky options read "Always allow any `<tool>`", matching their real scope.
- **Breaking:** `/v1/docs` and `/v1/openapi.json` are off unless `[serve].docs = true`.
- **Breaking:** an empty list prints its "none found" line on stderr, so stdout stays pipeable.
- `effort` and the thinking encoding are no longer inferred from a model's name, on any backend.
- `agent_followup` never widens a recorded grant, even when the parent has moved sideways since.
- `memory_write` and `skill_write` keep a stored description when the call omits it.
- Memory has no discovery cap and no per-turn walk; the index is one indexed query over FTS5.
- The `[Skills]` index is ordered by priority and capped, then points at `skill_search`.
- An unknown or stale tool name now suggests the built-in it probably meant.
- `[display].input_style` applies on submit; text keeps the terminal's own colors while typing.
- Every built-in tool indicator is PascalCase; whole families used to render as raw snake_case.
- Every rendered line is budgeted whole, so none wraps by default and a cut keeps both ends.
- CLI output that is not requested data moved to stderr or the log, keeping stdout pipeable.
- Building meka needs Rust 1.95, declared in `Cargo.toml` so an older toolchain is refused by name.
- Upgrade `rmcp` to 3.1, reedline to 0.50, `base64` to 0.23, `infer` to 0.22, `termimad` to 0.35.
- The `ask` prompt shows every argument, refuses on Ctrl+D, and ignores input typed before it drew.
- `MEKA_DATA_DIR` must be absolute, and an empty or relative `MEKA_CONFIG_DIR` is ignored.
- A command-output capture is created at `0600` and swept after a day.
- `utoipa-swagger-ui` is vendored, so a build no longer downloads an unpinned, unverified zip.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** in-binary store migration; 0.41 -> 0.42 is a script shipped with the release.
- **Breaking:** `source_url` and `meka skill update`; clone the source into `[skills].extra_paths`.
- **Breaking:** the read-time move of a skill's top-level `version` / `author` under `metadata`.
- **Breaking:** a top-level `priority` is no longer a skill's rank; the release script moves it.
- **Breaking:** reading a bare-string `tool_result` or bare `signature`; the script converts both.
- The model-metadata subsystem: the models-API probe, its cache table, and the window table.

### Fixed

- Every macOS `read` command failed: the Seatbelt profile no longer parses, so nothing ran at all.
- Under bubblewrap a `read` command whose cwd was masked silently ran in `$HOME` instead.
- Landlock allows writing `/dev/null`, so `cmd 2>/dev/null` no longer fails on that backend.
- The bubblewrap probe could strand a `bwrap` if meka died before the sandbox armed its own guard.
- A failed Windows replace could delete the target and the replacement; the content is now rescued.
- A Windows write replaced the target's ACL with the directory's; `ReplaceFileW` now keeps it.
- Windows writes past `MAX_PATH` keep working: the Win32 call re-adds the prefix meka strips.
- `~\path` is expanded on Windows; it was treated as a literal directory named `~`.
- `/cd` on Windows stored a `\\?\` path, which then reached the prompt, the model and the DB.
- Windows dropped an environment variable whose *value* was not valid UTF-8 from the sandbox.
- Two files whose names differ outside UTF-8 shared one temp file, splicing a write into the other.
- A non-UTF-8 path slipped past the hidden-file skip and read as missing to the search tools.
- `find_files` left a trailing `\` on a Windows root, so the glob's separator handling decided.
- File writes are atomic and serialized per path, so a crash or a concurrent edit cannot lose one.
- Store files and roots are created private, and a rewrite no longer re-modes a file or its target.
- `config.toml` writes take an exclusive lock and follow symlinks, so no edit is silently dropped.
- Store writes release their lock before `$EDITOR`; `$VISUAL` and editor arguments are honored.
- `scratchpad_save_file` refuses to replace a file without `force`, and records its write.
- `read_file` discloses every cut, preserves CRLF, bounds itself at 16 MiB, and windows past it.
- Every door said a skill did not exist when its `SKILL.md` was there but would not parse.
- A listed skill can always be deleted. `con`, `two words` and `my:skill` had no way out but `rm`.
- `meka skill add --force` deleted the skill before writing, losing it if the write never happened.
- A skill rewrite alphabetised or re-nested frontmatter keys meka does not model.
- A skill's description and `compatibility` are stored verbatim, not sanitized into the only copy.
- A `SKILL.md` whose closing `---` ends the file was reported as having no frontmatter.
- A memory whose name meka would not write, including one over 64 characters, was unreachable.
- A turn that could not read the memory store told the model every memory had been deleted.
- `memory_search` was case-sensitive, stopped at 100 matches mid-walk, and mismeasured near misses.
- `memory_read` had no size bound, and said nothing for a memory that has only a description.
- Memory text reached the model unsanitized; only descriptions were filtered before.
- A memory's age was its edit time, and a future date read as "today" while sorting first.
- The per-turn memory index was read on every turn even with `[memory] enabled = false`.
- The per-turn diff listed every changed memory by name, unbounded; a bulk change is now counted.
- The `[Memory]` index told the model to call `memory_write` or `memory_search` when disabled.
- `chatgpt-subscription` discarded the encrypted reasoning it asked for; it is now replayed.
- Resuming a `chatgpt-subscription` session under Claude replayed OpenAI's blob as a signature.
- Reasoning was captured only when a summary came with it, losing it on every silent think.
- Reasoning summary sections ran together; each part now starts a new paragraph.
- `/status` shows the context window from turn zero, so a configured window is verifiable up front.
- `[session].context_messages` applies every round; a tool loop cannot carry the window past it.
- Unparseable tool arguments and truncated streams are rejected and retried, not committed as done.
- `--no-stream` shows the model's reply; the blocking path rendered nothing but tool indicators.
- `load_tool` promised a schema "on your next turn" even when every name failed to resolve.
- Shift+Tab stacked a new prompt line once a turn had scrolled the prompt to the screen bottom.
- An unreadable persisted permission was read as the process default, silently; it now warns.
- `[permissions].enabled` naming no usable mode fell back to a *wider* default set than written.
- ACP mode ids parse the way `--permission` does and echo back one of `availableModes`.
- ACP `session/close` and `session/cancel` no longer deadlock or strand an `fs/*` round trip.
- Two hosts on one database both fired every job; an occurrence is now claimed atomically.
- A deferred job's restore overwrote another host's claim, so an occurrence came due twice.
- A database hiccup during a sweep dropped an occurrence and skipped every other job due that tick.
- A one-shot job was destroyed when its gate timed out or failed to spawn, having answered nothing.
- A canceled or retired job left its held-back state behind for the life of a `meka serve`.
- A gate is re-checked against the live permission, runs in its session's cwd, and `list` shows it.
- An `on-change` gate that exits non-zero is reported, not folded into the comparison or refused.
- `cron` parses the documented five fields, and a job whose next fire is years out is kept.
- A session is locked before its row exists, so nothing can sweep or interleave one mid-creation.
- `meka session fork` and `export` copied a conversation mid-turn, producing an unusable session.
- The retention sweep and `session delete --all` skip sessions in use, and say how many.
- Retention spares a session that owns a scheduled job, and its ancestors.
- The lock-file sweep unlinked locks live processes held, letting two attach to one session.
- A first launch racing another for a fresh database could die converting to WAL; it retries.
- `meka serve` evicted a session with a background task running, then swept its own live task.
- `agent_followup` is refused while another process is running a turn on the same sub-agent.
- A streaming turn survives its SSE consumer disconnecting for `[serve].stream_reattach_grace`.
- `meka mcp add` held the config lock across the browser login, hanging every other meka launch.
- MCP servers are closed on exit on every surface, and the close is bounded so it cannot hang exit.
- Every provider, client and MCP round trip is bounded and cancelable; a stall cannot park a turn.
- Shutdown drains in-flight turns, scheduled fires and background tasks instead of abandoning them.
- Blocking work moved off the async runtime, where it stalled other sessions under `meka serve`.
- Ctrl-C is one process-wide listener that escalates; the third press drains before it exits.
- A panic in a GC, scheduler, outcome or prune loop is logged and the next tick runs.
- OAuth callbacks decode `+` as a space, matching the form encoding the redirect actually uses.
- A base URL's trailing slash or version segment no longer reaches the wire doubled.
- A token refresh cannot store a dead credential or overwrite a `provider login` mid-flight.

### Security

- A `bwrap` planted earlier on `$PATH` than the real one unconfined every sandboxed command.
- An MCP tool required at `ask` dispatched with neither a prompt nor a boundary.
- A memory name reached the model unsanitized, so a newline in one forged a `[Memory]` entry.
- A gate kept firing at a level `[permissions].enabled` no longer permits, after a restart.
- Secrets no longer reach a log, a `{:?}`, a 502 body, or the terminal echo at the API-key prompt.
- Streamed model output, MCP text and prompts drop escapes, bidi overrides and carriage returns.
- Skill writes refuse a symlinked path instead of writing outside the store.
- `event-listener` and `memmap2` move to patched releases, and the audit ignore list is gone.
- RUSTSEC-2026-0258: `h2` moves to 0.4.19, past an unbounded empty-DATA-frame denial of service.
- **Known limitation:** a Windows `workspace` command can read meka's memory, credentials included.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `web_search` is now `search_web`.
- **Breaking:** `recall` and `recall_read` are now `conversation_search` and `conversation_read`.
- **Breaking:** MCP meta-tools put the object first: `read_mcp_resource` is `mcp_resource_read`.
- **Breaking:** a `disabled_tools` entry naming a renamed tool stops denying it; update on upgrade.

## [0.40.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- `agent_followup` asks a sub-agent another question; it keeps its own conversation.
- `agent_list` reports a session's sub-agents, with each one's turn count and last activity.
- `agent_delete` discards a sub-agent, its scratchpad, and any sub-agents it spawned.
- `agent_spawn` returns the sub-agent's id, so a worker can be reached again.
- `[subagents]` config: `disabled_servers` and `disabled_tools`, withheld from every sub-agent.
- `agent_spawn` takes `deny_servers` / `deny_tools`, unioned with what config already denies.
- A denied MCP server is unreachable through its resources and prompts, not just its tools.
- `agent_spawn` takes `memory: "read"` to grant a worker your memories; the default is none.
- `agent_spawn` takes `instructions: "inherit"` to hand a worker the instructions file.
- Neither grant can exceed what the spawning agent holds, so authority narrows down a chain.
- The `[Memory]` index names memory files that could not be read, with the reason for each.
- A resumed session tells the agent that state a tool held outside the conversation may be gone.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** the `spawn_agent` tool is now `agent_spawn`, matching every other tool family.
- **Breaking:** sub-agents start with no memory and no instructions unless `agent_spawn` asks.
- **Breaking:** Landlock blocks Unix sockets on kernel 7.1+; `docker` and `psql` fail in read mode.

### Fixed

- `[tools].disabled_tools` now applies to the MCP resource and prompt tools, which ignored it.
- `[tools]` no longer warns that `recall`, `schedule_*` or `task_*` match no built-in tool.
- `[tools].allowed_tools` naming an MCP meta-tool now says so instead of silently doing nothing.
- `meka acp` and `meka serve` warn about stale `[tools]` entries; only the REPL did.
- `agent_spawn` ignored a non-string `permission`, silently running the worker unrestricted.
- Sub-agents inherit auto-compaction, so a worker given a large task no longer just fails.
- A compacting sub-agent no longer disables extended thinking for a sibling running beside it.
- `memory_write` without a `body` erased the memory's body; it now keeps what is there.
- `memory_read` on a name whose file exists but will not parse reported it as never written.
- A Landlock setup failure could report the wrong `errno`, since `close(2)` may overwrite it.

### Security

- Read-mode commands under Landlock could write anywhere via `systemd-run`; now blocked on ABI v9+.
- Bubblewrap was never affected: its tmpfs masks already hid the systemd and D-Bus sockets.

## [0.39.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- `provider list` and `mcp list` now report stored credentials that no config entry claims.
- A live `Thinking... (150 tokens)` indicator, so redacted reasoning is no longer a silent pause.
- Background tool calls: `background: true` returns a task id and reports the result later.
- A background task always reports back, including as `interrupted` when a restart killed it.
- `[background]` config, off by default, with `enabled` and a per-session `max_tasks` ceiling.
- `task_list` / `task_cancel` tools, a `/tasks` command, and a `[Background]` context section.
- Ctrl+C cancels the turn and leaves background tasks running; a second press stops them.
- `load_tool` accepts an array of names, so several tools off one server cost one round trip.
- An unknown tool name suggests the closest match, allowing for a missing `mcp__` prefix.
- The agent is told when a call sends undeclared arguments or leaves documented parameters unset.
- `[Context budget]` tells the agent its context occupancy and when auto-compaction will fire.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `[display].render_mode` defaults to `termimad`; set `syntect` for the old look.

### Fixed

- `mcp remove` clears the credential of a server deleted from config by hand instead of refusing.
- `provider remove` no longer reports success for a name with no profile and no credential.
- `edit_file` overwrote a file that changed after the read; it now reports the change instead.
- Under ACP, `read_file` with `regex` searched the file on disk rather than the editor's copy.
- A wrong-typed `scratchpad` argument is refused, rather than silently discarding the output.
- `/mcp <server>:<prompt>` with an unknown server hung the REPL instead of drawing a new prompt.
- `termimad` hard-wrapped redirected output to a 50-column fallback instead of not wrapping.
- `[display]` blank-line spacing now brackets slash-command output, not only agent responses.
- `/export` now reports the path it wrote to; it used to save a file and say nothing.
- `/history` on an empty conversation, and `/mcp reconnect|login|logout`, now say what happened.
- `meka tools list` used fixed column widths, so a long MCP tool name ran the columns together.
- Deferred tool summaries were cut at the first sentence, hiding parameters documented later.
- `[Tool discovery]` claimed deferred tools were "not yet callable" when calling one works.

## [0.38.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Agent memory: durable Markdown notes in `~/.config/meka/memory/`, surviving compaction.
- `memory_write` / `memory_read` / `memory_search` / `memory_delete` tools, all at read permission.
- `meka memory` subcommands and `/memory [name]` to list, inspect, and curate saved memories.
- `[memory] enabled` config (default true) to drop the memory tools and index entirely.
- `[skills] enabled` config (default true) to drop the `skill` tool and skills index entirely.
- Scheduled wakeups: the agent can schedule its own future turns with `schedule_create`.
- `schedule_list` / `schedule_cancel` tools, `meka schedule list|cancel`, and `/schedule`.
- Job gates: a shell command decides whether a due job spends a model turn, so polling is cheap.
- `[schedule]` config for the poll interval, missed-job grace, gate timeout, and per-session cap.
- Scheduled jobs fire under `meka serve`, the REPL, and ACP; `serve` is the durable host.
- Instructions live in `instructions.md`, or split across `instructions/*.md`, in the config dir.
- `MEKA_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE` reads instructions from a path, for mounted ConfigMaps and secrets.
- `meka instructions show` / `path` report the resolved text and where it came from.
- `/rewind [N]` and `meka session rewind` drop recent turns, so a stuck session is recoverable.
- `[[mcp.servers]].required` and `meka mcp add --required` gate a turn on one server, not all.
- `meka session delete --older-than-days <DAYS>` prunes old sessions on demand.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** an unparseable `config.toml` is a startup error, not a silent fallback to defaults.
- **Breaking:** `[prompt].instructions` is gone; move the text to `instructions.md` to start.
- **Breaking:** `[mcp] strict` defaults to false; a server gates a turn only if `required = true`.
- **Breaking:** `[session] retention_days` has no default; unset now keeps every session forever.
- `--instructions` and `MEKA_INSTRUCTIONS` are unaffected; only the config-file key moved.
- `[session] retention_days = 0` is now rejected; it would have deleted everything each startup.
- A configured retention sweep now reports deletions at `warn` instead of `info`.
- `GET /v1/health/ready` ignores failed *optional* MCP servers; only `required` ones mean 503.
- reedline moved from a personal fork to upstream `main`.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `[session] max_storage_bytes` is gone; delete the key or meka won't start.
- **Breaking:** `${MEKA_SKILL_DIR}` / `${MEKA_SESSION_ID}` in skills; use relative paths instead.

### Fixed

- One provider-rejected message killed a session for good; meka now drops the content and retries.
- The model is told what the provider refused, so it can adapt instead of losing the turn.
- Images were labeled from the filename, `Content-Type`, or MCP `mime_type` instead of the bytes.
- A session already holding a mislabeled image is repaired on resume, with no provider call.
- MCP images above the size providers accept were forwarded anyway, only to be rejected.
- OpenAI-compatible streaming dropped a tool call or text that shared a chunk with `finish_reason`.
- REPL text streamed before an interrupt or error no longer leaks into the next turn's output.
- Calling a tool from an unconnected MCP server said "Unknown tool" instead of naming the cause.
- An unreachable MCP server logged its failure on every background retry, forever; now once.
- `meka provider add <existing>` could overwrite a profile when `config.toml` failed to parse.
- `meka provider remove` truncated `config.toml` to nothing when the file couldn't be read.
- An absurdly large `retention_days` panicked the retention sweep instead of keeping everything.
- The skills and memory indexes no longer render when the tool that opens them is disabled.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/turn` accepts inline `images`, so a remote client can send a picture.
- `GET /v1/info` reports `vision` so clients can check before attaching an image.
- `GET /v1/sessions/{id}` reports `turn_in_flight` so a reconnecting client needn't guess.
- `POST /v1/sessions` accepts `supports_permission_prompts`; false denies gated tools at once.
- MCP `tools/call` now carries `meka/sessionId` in `_meta` so servers can scope session state.
- ACP multi-root workspaces: extra folders are searched and named, not silently dropped.
- Fork a session into an independent copy from the CLI, REPL, HTTP, or ACP.
- ACP clients now see `execute_command` output as it is produced, not only when the command exits.
- Editors that render agent-owned terminals now show shell output live, in a real terminal.

### Changed

- `termimad` render mode is now colored from the same theme as `syntect` instead of grayscale.
- `termimad` no longer centers a top-level heading, which read as a formatting glitch.
- Tools, skills, and MCP instructions moved from the system prompt into the per-turn context.
- **Breaking:** `-c` takes no session id; use `-r`/`--resume <SESSION>` to resume a specific one.
- **Breaking:** `execute_command` no longer runs in the ACP client's terminal; meka always owns it.

### Fixed

- `--oneshot` now honors `-c`/`-r` instead of silently starting a new session.
- Loading a deferred tool no longer reorders the tools array, which invalidated the prompt cache.
- A new skill or a reconnecting MCP server no longer re-caches the whole conversation.
- ACP clients now see images a tool looked at, instead of an `[image]` placeholder.
- `meka session import` no longer leaves a restored session for retention GC to delete.
- Session export/import no longer drops a session's additional workspace roots.
- Re-attaching a session over HTTP now drops orphaned tool calls that broke its next turn.
- An MCP server that fails its initial connect is now retried in the background until it comes up.
- MCP `tools/call` now actually sends `meka/toolUseId`; it was never populated at the call site.
- A command printing a non-UTF-8 byte had its whole output dropped; it is now decoded lossily.
- `syntect` and `raw` dropped a reply's trailing table or unclosed code fence rather than show it.
- `termimad` mode parses real CommonMark: `-`/`+` bullets, `__bold__`, `_italic_`, and links.
- `termimad` mode reflows multi-line paragraphs to the terminal width instead of per line.
- `termimad` mode no longer splits a fenced code block that contains a blank line.
- A `#` or `|` line inside a fenced code block no longer gets blank lines inserted into it.

### Security

- ACP `ask` mode delegated shell commands to the client's terminal, bypassing meka's sandbox.

## [0.36.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- ACP clients now see a sub-agent's tool calls stream into its `spawn_agent` tool call.
- MCP servers can now prompt for input in an ACP editor; these were previously always declined.
- `session/prompt` responses now carry session-cumulative token usage.

### Changed

- Upgrade `agent-client-protocol` to 2.0, matching the major version Zed uses.
- `search_contents` now stops searching once the inline match cap is exceeded.

### Fixed

- `find_files` and `search_contents` now stop after 60 seconds instead of running unbounded.
- Both search tools now honor Ctrl+C and ACP `session/cancel`.
- A search that was cut short now says so instead of reporting "no matches".
- Searching no longer logs one warning per unreadable path.
- meka can now read and edit files outside the project an ACP editor has open.
- An ACP write that bypassed the editor now says so in the tool result.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Claude Opus 5 and Sonnet 5 to the model catalog.

### Changed

- Default new Claude provider profiles to `claude-opus-5`.
- Never send reasoning effort to a Claude Haiku model; the tier has no effort knob.

### Fixed

- Don't send `temperature` to Opus 5, Sonnet 5, or any unrecognized model.
- Default Claude Mythos Preview to `high` effort; it supports `max` but not `xhigh`.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- `claude-api` now supports the `output_config.effort` knob.
- Detect a model's context window from the provider API when unknown, cached in the DB.
- `/status` now shows the resolved model, provider, reasoning effort, and thinking state.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Reject unknown keys in config files instead of silently ignoring them.
- Unify the effort knob into one `effort` config key for all providers.
- Reasoning effort now defaults per model: `xhigh` where supported, else `high`.
- An explicit effort override is absolute: sent verbatim, no validation or clamping.
- `openai-codex` reads its models catalog for the effort default, not a name guess.
- Match Claude Code 2.1.217 request fidelity.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** Remove the `reasoning_effort` config key; use `effort` instead.

### Fixed

- Recognize Claude Opus 4.5 as effort-capable; it was wrongly omitting effort.
- Don't send reasoning effort to OpenAI models that don't support it, including local models.
- Infer real context windows for gpt-5 models, not 128k.
- Infer 1M context for Claude Opus 4.6+/Sonnet 4.6/Fable 5; Haiku and older stay 200k.

## [0.33.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Auto-compaction on openai-codex no longer fails; `complete` now aggregates its own SSE stream.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Codex login accepts a pasted callback URL when the loopback callback can't be reached.
- Recursive sub-agents, bounded by `session.subagent_max_depth` (default 3) and `max_depth`.
- `spawn_agent` gains a `permission` param to restrict a sub-agent below the parent's level.

### Changed

- Default OpenAI model for new provider profiles is now `gpt-5.6-sol`.

### Fixed

- Report Codex tool-call turns as `tool_use`, not `end_turn`, so they no longer warn.
- Retry a transient mid-stream transport error before any output, instead of failing the turn.
- Add a Codex SSE idle timeout so a hung stream fails fast and retries instead of blocking.

## [0.32.1] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Parse Claude's `extra_usage` credit fields as floats.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Syntax-highlight fenced code blocks by their language in the terminal renderer (syntect mode).

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Rename the `bat` render mode to `syntect`, after the actual highlighter.
- Upgrade `rmcp` to 2.1 and `agent-client-protocol` to 1.0.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** Remove the MCP sampling, roots, and logging handlers and the `sampling` config/CLI.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- `meka session export --format json` writes a structured, round-trippable export with sub-agents.
- `meka session import <file>` recreates a session tree from a JSON export under fresh IDs.

### Fixed

- Persist user input images instead of dropping them at save time, so they survive resume/export.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- `/usage` command shows account rate-limit windows for `claude-oauth` and `openai-codex`.
- `meka account usage` / `whoami` / `stats` CLI with `--format plain|json` for scripting.
- Retry transient provider errors (429/5xx incl. 529) with bounded backoff, honoring `Retry-After`.

### Fixed

- Handle Claude's mid-stream `event: error` instead of silently dropping it.

## [0.29.4] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- Resolve relative links in fetched pages to absolute URLs against the page's final URL.

### Fixed

- Preserve `<nav>` and `<footer>` links when fetching a page; both were dropped as boilerplate.

## [0.29.3] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- Capture a stdio MCP server's stderr into tracing instead of letting it corrupt the REPL display.

## [0.29.2] - 2026-06-26

### Changed

- Compaction keeps a token-budgeted recent tail and uses a richer, security-aware summary prompt.
- Compact proactively when the next request would overflow the context window, not only reactively.

### Fixed

- Recover from a provider context-window overflow by compacting once and retrying, not failing.

## [0.29.1] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Report context usage to ACP clients via the standard `usage_update` notification.
- Expose `/status` and `/mcp` as ACP slash commands alongside skills.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Log a warning for unrecognized provider stop reasons (e.g. `pause_turn`) for diagnosability.

### Changed

- Match newest Claude Code request fidelity.

### Fixed

- Recover thinking-only model turns with a one-shot nudge instead of ending the turn with no text.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- REPL now Tab-completes slash-command names and highlights the command token.
- REPL Tab-completes slash-command arguments: permission levels, skills, MCP servers, /cd paths.
- `meka history list` / `meka history clear` view and clear REPL input history.
- `recall` / `recall_read` tools search and read the full conversation, including compacted turns.

### Changed

- Session subcommands `list`, `export`, and `delete` moved under `meka session` for consistency.
- `meka session export` now exports the full conversation, including turns hidden by compaction.

## [0.27.3] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- Detect adaptive thinking / effort by excluding known pre-4.6 models, not gating on `>= 4.6`.

### Fixed

- Execute tool calls present in the assistant message regardless of the reported stop reason.
- Show a stand-in message when the model refuses with empty content, instead of a blank turn.

## [0.27.2] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- ACP editor integration gained plans, embedded resource/image input, titles, and tool-call detail.
- `[providers.<name>]` gains `context_window`, `vision`, and `max_output_tokens` overrides.

### Fixed

- Gate adaptive thinking / effort on the parsed Claude model version (`>= 4.6`), not an allowlist.
- REPL log warnings now appear during a turn instead of being buffered until the next prompt.
- Interrupting a turn now persists the partial assistant text so it survives resume.
- `meka acp` exits on client disconnect (stdin EOF) or SIGTERM/Ctrl-C, releasing its session lock.

## [0.27.1] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- `!` shell escape and `scratchpad_load_file` / `save_file` honor `/cd`, not the process cwd.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- `meka acp` subcommand for editors that speak the Agent Client Protocol.
- `meka serve` subcommand exposes the agent over HTTP+JSON.
- `meka provider` suite (add/list/use/login/remove) to configure and switch named profiles.
- REPL input history persists across runs in the SQLite DB.
- `MEKA_SANDBOX_BACKEND` overrides `[shell].sandbox_backend`; mekabox uses it to pin Landlock.
- `--sandbox-backend` flag, so the backend is settable via config, env, and CLI consistently.
- `MEKA_RENDER_MODE` overrides `[display].render_mode` for CI / non-TTY runs.
- `/status` shows live context-window usage (tokens / window, percent used, tokens left).
- Cumulative `/status` stats now persist per session and continue across resume.
- `display.show_context_in_prompt` shows a live context gauge in the REPL prompt (opt-in).

### Changed

- Renamed the project `agsh` → `meka`: binary, `~/.config/meka` config dir, `MEKA_*` env vars.
- Renamed the database `sessions.db` → `meka.db`; it now holds more than sessions.
- Providers are now named `[providers.<name>]` profiles with secrets stored in the DB, not config.
- `serde_yaml` (unmaintained) replaced with the maintained `serde_norway` fork.
- `edit_file` now rejects an ambiguous `old_string` (multiple matches without `replace_all`).
- Replaced `todo_write`/`todo_read` with one `todo` tool: `title`, `set` patches, `cancelled`.

### Removed

- `meka setup` wizard and all provider env vars (`MEKA_PROVIDER`, `MEKA_MODEL`, API keys, tokens).
- `[agent] max_turn_requests` cap; it was cutting off legitimate long-running workflows.

### Fixed

- User message persists eagerly so a crash mid-turn no longer loses it.
- OpenAI streaming requests token usage via `stream_options.include_usage`; it reported zero.
- Claude streaming usage merges `message_start` and `message_delta` instead of last-event-wins.
- Auto-compact now measures total context tokens (all tiers + output), correct with Claude caching.

## [0.26.2] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- `spawn_agent` accepts a `skill` parameter to run an installed skill in the sub-agent.

### Changed

- Loaded skill bodies now lead with the skill's base directory so bundled files resolve.

## [0.26.1] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- CI runs `cargo audit` to flag known security advisories in dependencies.

### Changed

- The stream-event channel is bounded and the event log is pruned after compaction, capping memory.
- `grep` traverses directories iteratively, so a deeply-nested tree can't overflow the stack.
- `grep` no longer descends into symlinked directories, removing any symlink-cycle traversal risk.

### Fixed

- Large-output shell commands no longer time out spuriously: the pipes drain before the wait.
- Malformed OpenAI tool-call arguments are rejected explicitly instead of run with empty input.
- `write_file` rejects symlinked targets on Windows, matching the `O_NOFOLLOW` behavior on Unix.
- Landlock sandbox (ABI v6+) now blocks abstract Unix sockets and cross-domain signals.
- Blocking skill-discovery, skill-load, and OS-detection calls no longer stall the async runtime.
- Session-lock guard drop order is now explicit, removing a field-reorder use-after-free hazard.
- Numeric casts on tool inputs (offsets, limits, sizes) are bounds-checked instead of overflowing.
- `todo_write` rejects an unrecognized task status instead of silently mis-rendering it.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- `agsh skill update` re-fetches skills from their `source_url` and replaces them on disk.
- Skill frontmatter gains optional `author` and `source_url` fields.

### Changed

- `skill list`, `mcp list`, `mcp tools` and `list` share one column formatter with dynamic widths.

### Removed

- Skill frontmatter fields `when_to_use`, `allowed_tools`, and `user_invocable`.

### Fixed

- Orphaned session lock files are pruned at startup and after deletions instead of accumulating.

## [0.25.2] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- Setup wizard no longer prompts for a sandbox backend: it auto-detects at runtime.

### Fixed

- Ctrl+C now interrupts turns started by `/skill` and `/mcp prompt` (and their sub-agents).

## [0.25.1] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- `scratchpad_merge` combines multiple entries into one without routing bytes through context.

### Changed

- `find_files` default cap raised to 500, with a `limit` param; truncation reports the real total.
- `write_file` marks its target as read so `edit_file` no longer needs `force: true` after.
- `read_file`/`find_files`/`search_contents`/`execute_command` descriptions note parallel dispatch.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- `spawn_agent` gains `inherit_scratchpad`: grant the sub-agent read-only access to parent entries.
- `scratchpad_load_file` streams a file into the scratchpad without routing bytes through context.
- `scratchpad_save_file` writes a scratchpad entry to disk without routing bytes through context.
- `scratchpad_rename` renames an entry in place without round-tripping content through the model.

### Changed

- Sub-agents now run unbounded; the prior 20-round cap is removed, no replacement knob.
- `scratchpad_list` renders own and inherited entries in one table with an `Origin` column.
- Scratchpad tool output reports sizes in bytes (was mislabeled "characters": always byte counts).

### Fixed

- Sub-agent writes to inherited scratchpad names error instead of silently shadowing the parent.

## [0.24.1] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Schema upgrade from a 0.23.x DB no longer fails with `no such column: parent_session_id`.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Sub-agent sessions persist as DB children for auditing; `agsh list --include-children` to view.
- Sub-agents get `load_tool`, `render_image` and every scratchpad tool, scoped to their session.
- `RenderMode::Silent` suppresses all agent output; used by sub-agents.

### Changed

- Sub-agents inherit the parent's MCP tools.
- Sub-agents now run on `Agent::run_turn`; bespoke loop removed.
- Sub-agent token usage now rolls into the parent's `/status` totals.
- Added `idx_sessions_updated_at` so `list`, `resume`, and prune skip the temp sort.
- Session deletion / pruning / storage-limit eviction now rely on `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

### Removed

- Unused `sessions.metadata` column.

### Fixed

- Enable `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` so `messages` / `tool_outputs` FK clauses are enforced.

## [0.23.1] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- Skills cached at startup with mtime-based auto-reload; parse warnings now fire at startup.

### Fixed

- `/skill <name>` error paths no longer hang the REPL when the skill is missing or non-invocable.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- `[shell].sandbox_backend` picks `"landlock"` or `"bubblewrap"` for Linux read-mode sandboxing.
- Setup wizard prompts for the Linux sandbox backend when both options are available.
- `todo_read` tool lets the model fetch the current task list on demand.
- Tool calls in one assistant message dispatch in parallel, `spawn_agent` calls included.

### Changed

- Linux read-mode sandboxing uses Bubblewrap when installed; pin `sandbox_backend` to opt out.
- `execute_command` in read mode hard-errors when the configured sandbox backend is unavailable.
- Sub-agents inherit the parent's permission level instead of being capped at read.
- Each sub-agent has a private todo list, and its `todo_write` no longer renders to the user.
- macOS read-mode sandbox profile hardened: IPC mutation now blocked alongside filesystem writes.

### Fixed

- Windows command timeout now kills the full process tree via a Job Object.
- Session database path no longer defaults to Linux's on macOS or Windows; set `AGSH_DATA_DIR`.

### Security

- `sandbox-exec` invoked via absolute path `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` instead of `$PATH` lookup.
- Read-mode shell now scrubs the child environment on Linux and macOS (Windows already did).

## [0.22.1] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- `--eager-load-tool SERVER:TOOL` adds session-only entries to a server's `eager_load_tools` list.

### Changed

- CLI `-h` output tightened to fit 80 columns across every subcommand.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- `edit_file` gains `insert_before` and `insert_after` for inserts that rewrite no context.
- `read_file` gained a `regex` parameter mirroring `scratchpad_read`'s line-grep mode.
- Per-server `eager_load_tools` puts named MCP tools in the cacheable prefix, skipping `load_tool`.
- `/history [N]` and `[display].resume_show_recent` reprint past turns in REPL style.

### Changed

- `edit_file` success responses now include a ±3-line snippet around the first edited site.
- `scratchpad_read`, `_edit`, `_list` and `_delete` ship active, with no `load_tool` round trip.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-05-10

### Changed

- Reqwest error messages now expose the full source chain (timeout, reset, TLS, etc.).

## [0.21.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- `agsh -c <prefix>` resumes a session by UUID prefix; ambiguous prefixes list matches.
- `openai-codex` provider sends tool-result images as `input_image` blocks (Responses API).

### Fixed

- Images over 2000 px on either axis are downscaled for Claude, per Anthropic's multi-image cap.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- `/status` slash command shows turns, tokens, cache hit ratio, redactions, and message count.
- `[display].show_token_usage` toggles a per-turn `[in / cache hit % / out]` line on stderr.
- `TokenUsage` carries Anthropic's `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

### Changed

- Image redaction drops to a ~24 MiB watermark, not the minimum, amortizing cache invalidation.
- Image redaction prints a stderr advisory when it fires; it was invisible at default verbosity.

### Fixed

- Claude requests reactively redact oldest tool-result images when body exceeds 30 MiB.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- `--skill <NAME>` invokes a user-invocable skill as the first turn; `[PROMPT]` is prepended.
- `--oneshot` flag exits after the first turn finishes; requires `[PROMPT]` or `--skill`.

### Changed

- Bare `[PROMPT]` / `--skill` now drop into the REPL after the first turn.
- Tool indicators, thinking, todos, spacing newlines, setup prompts, OAuth URLs output to stderr.

### Fixed

- OAuth refresh re-reads the latest stored token, fixing `invalid_grant` between concurrent runs.

## [0.18.4] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- `--instructions` / `AGSH_INSTRUCTIONS` overrides `[prompt].instructions` for one run.
- `agbox` sets `AGSH_INSTRUCTIONS` so the agent knows it can install packages freely.

## [0.18.3] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed

- Skill discovery skips dot-prefixed entries such as `.git` and `.DS_Store` instead of warning.

## [0.18.2] - 2026-05-01

### Changed

- OAuth callback `code`/`state`/`error` parameters are decoded with strict UTF-8, not lossy.
- Session DB pre-touched at 0600 and data/lock/config dirs born at 0700 to close umask windows.

### Fixed

- `search_contents` rejects invalid glob patterns instead of silently scanning the whole tree.
- `set_permissions` failures on the config directory now log a warning instead of being discarded.
- `.expect()` panics on tool registration and compaction-boundary lookup replaced with `?`.
- New `AgshError::Internal` variant for logic-invariant failures that previously panicked.
- MCP tool annotation/meta serialization failures now warn-log instead of being silently dropped.
- `libc::kill` failures during process-group teardown now logged at `debug!`.

### Security

- `canonicalize_for_tool` now errors on resolution failure; `write_file` canonicalizes the parent.
- JWT signing-key permissions now checked on the open `File` to close the stat-then-read TOCTOU.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- `[permissions]` config: pick enabled modes and start mode; `ask` is now opt-in by default.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- `agsh skill list | get | show | add | remove` CLI subcommands for managing user skills.
- `/skill` lists skills; `/skill <name> [extra...]` invokes one, the extra text as a directive.
- `--edit` flag on `agsh skill add` opens the new `SKILL.md` in `$EDITOR` after scaffolding.
- `--from-file` on `agsh skill add` copies an existing template instead of scaffolding from flags.

### Changed

- `/skill <name>` rejects skills marked `user_invocable: false` (gate now consumed).
- `/help` now lists `/skill` and `/mcp` slash commands (previously omitted).
- `scratchpad_read` description and `<large-output>` preview advertise no hard cap on `limit`.

## [0.17.2] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- Pinned reedline to a fork containing the fix for upstream `nushell/reedline` issue #1005.
- Long log lines through `ExternalPrinter` no longer cause an apparent screen clear on REPL start.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- Startup log lines no longer get clobbered by reedline's prompt redraw.
- `tracing` output flows through reedline's `ExternalPrinter` and prints above the live prompt.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- `load_tool` meta-tool: exposes a deferred tool's schema for use on the next turn.
- `## Tool Discovery` system-prompt section: deferred tools grouped by source.
- `Conversation` newtype wraps the message log; only `append` plus three named methods mutate it.
- Event-sourced conversation persistence: `Vec<Event>` (`Append` + `CompactBoundary`).
- `CompactBoundary::loaded_tools_snapshot` carries the active deferred-tool set across compaction.

### Changed

- Deferred tools are activated by `load_tool` calls in the conversation (no in-memory state).
- System prompt is byte-stable across deferred-tool activation (cache breakpoint 2 stays warm).
- Resumed sessions reconstruct the active tool set from the conversation: no out-of-band state.
- REPL `agsh mcp tools` STATUS column renamed to VISIBILITY.
- `compact_session` appends a `compact_boundary` row instead of DELETEing: log stays append-only.
- All conversation persistence flows through `save_event` / `load_events`.
- Terminology unified: `Conversation` (type), `Event` (storage atom), `Message` (API atom).

### Removed

- `ToolRegistry::activate()` and dispatch-side auto-promotion of deferred tools.
- `SessionManager::clear_messages_only`: no caller after the event-log refactor.
- `pub` visibility on `save_message` / `load_messages` / `StoredMessage`: internal helpers now.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- `Continuing session: ...` notice now respects `[display].newline_after_prompt`.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- `openai-codex` provider: ChatGPT subscription auth via OpenAI Responses API.
- `OPENAI_CODEX_TOKEN` env var and `CODEX_CLIENT_ID` override for the Codex login flow.
- `agsh setup` wizard now offers a "ChatGPT subscription login" option.
- `[provider].effort` (claude-oauth): `output_config.effort` low/medium/high. Default high.
- `[provider].redact_thinking` (claude-oauth): send `redact-thinking-2026-02-12`. Default false.
- `[provider].device_id` (claude-oauth): override the persistent `metadata.user_id` device ID.

### Changed

- MCP tool namespace is now `mcp__<server>__<tool>`; matches Claude Code.
- Renamed provider `openai` → `openai-api` (room for a future Codex provider).
- Split provider `claude` into `claude-api` (API key) and `claude-oauth` (Claude Code OAuth).
- OAuth refresh tokens are preserved across the `claude` → `claude-oauth` rename.
- `claude-api` reads `CLAUDE_API_KEY` (no longer reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
- `claude-oauth` matches recent Claude Code: betas, context, fingerprint, cache and effort.
- `device_id` is generated/persisted only when the active provider is `claude-oauth`.
- `device_id` seeds from `~/.claude.json`'s `userID` when unset before generating a random one.
- `AuthCredential::OAuthToken` gains optional `account_id` for `openai-codex`'s account header.
- `oauth_tokens` table gains an `account_id` column; existing rows migrate with `NULL`.
- `openai-codex` reqwest client enables cookie jar so chatgpt.com bot-clearance cookies persist.
- `src/mcp.rs` (4754 lines) split into `mcp::{auth, transport, connector, handler}` submodules.
- `src/provider/claude/oauth.rs` (3286 lines) split into `oauth::attestation` + `claude::shared`.
- `src/config.rs` device_id / effort / credential helpers grouped into private inline submodules.
- `create_provider` replaced by `ProviderBuilder` (13 positional params → per-field setters).
- `claude-oauth` error-path body reads log at `warn!` on IO failure instead of silent fallback.
- MCP progress/elicitation sends log at `debug!` when the REPL receiver has been dropped.

### Fixed

- Missing `provider.name` errors with "no provider configured" before credential resolution.
- Unsupported `provider.name` errors with the list of valid providers.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- Tool-call indicators show the first required arg for MCP tools, not just built-ins.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- `[display].input_style = "reverse"` uses ANSI reverse video (swaps terminal fg/bg).
- `[mcp].strict`, `grace_seconds`, `connect_timeout_seconds` tune the per-turn readiness gate.
- `[[mcp.servers]].disabled` skips a server at startup without removing it from config.
- `agsh mcp disable <name>` / `agsh mcp enable <name>` toggle the disabled flag in config.toml.
- `agsh mcp add --disabled` stages a server without connecting to it on the next start.
- `web_search` detects DuckDuckGo CAPTCHA pages and returns a clear error instead of silent empty.
- `[web]` gains reqwest knobs: request/connect/read timeouts, max redirects, proxy, CA bundle, TLS.

### Changed

- MCP servers connect in parallel in the background; REPL opens immediately, not after Σ(connect).
- Default strict gate: turns abort when any enabled MCP server isn't connected.
- `/mcp list` in the REPL shows live state (connected / pending / failed / disabled) per server.
- `web_search` output: normalized whitespace, source-domain line, bold markdown on matched terms.

### Removed

- `web_search` Google and Bing engines (both consistently bot-blocked).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- `[tools]` gains `allowed_tools`, `disabled_tools` and `tool_permissions` for built-in tools.
- `agsh tools list` prints every built-in tool with its effective permission and enabled state.
- `[display].input_style` styles REPL input so submitted prompts stand out in scrollback.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- `agsh mcp tools --help` description trimmed to a single line.
- Renamed `src/shell.rs` to `src/repl.rs` and `src/mcp/env.rs` to `src/mcp/expand.rs`.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- `AGSH_CONFIG_DIR` env var overrides the default config directory on every platform.
- System prompt now lists every registered tool with its required permission level inline.
- Per-turn user message carries a `[Permission context]` block naming the current level.
- MCP permission chain: `tool_permissions` > `permission` > `readOnlyHint` > `default_permission`.
- `[mcp] default_permission` config key: global fallback when no server/tool/hint applies.
- `[[mcp.servers]]` supports `allowed_tools` / `disabled_tools` / `tool_permissions` overrides.
- `agsh mcp add` gains repeatable `--allow-tool`, `--disable-tool` and `--tool-permission`.
- `agsh mcp get <name>` now lists allow/block lists and per-tool permission overrides.
- A stale entry in `allowed_tools`, `disabled_tools` or `tool_permissions` warns at connect time.
- `agsh mcp tools <name>` lists every advertised tool, its permission, and which step decided it.
- `agsh mcp` CLI: `list`, `get`, `add`, `remove`, `reconnect`, `login`, `logout` subcommands.
- `agsh mcp add <name> <url-or-command> [args]` auto-detects transport (URL → http, else stdio).
- `agsh mcp add` flags for env/headers, permission, auth (oauth, client-credentials, -jwt, token).
- `agsh mcp add` probes HTTP servers post-persist (RFC 6750 / RFC 9728): 3 s redirects-off GET.
- `agsh mcp add` auto-runs OAuth on auth-required / `--auth oauth`; `--no-login` skips.
- `agsh mcp add` auto-login failure or Ctrl-C rolls the entry back (config + creds + probe cache).
- `agsh mcp login <name>` assumes OAuth authorization_code for an HTTP server with no `[auth]`.
- OAuth callback races the bound TCP listener against a stdin paste so logins work over SSH.
- `/mcp login <server>` and `/mcp logout <server>` REPL commands mirror the CLI subcommands.
- Server `InitializeResult.instructions` spliced into the system prompt each turn.
- Progress notifications forwarded to the REPL as a live status line under the running tool call.
- Form + URL elicitation: the shell prompts the user and returns typed values to the server.
- Tool annotations / `_meta` / `structuredContent` preserved through to the provider.
- Builtin MCP resource/prompt tools for list/read, subscribe/unsubscribe, and get-prompt flows.
- OAuth token revocation via `agsh mcp logout` (RFC 7009) + 15-min auth-probe cache for 401s.
- Tool-call timeout (`AGSH_MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT`, default 600s) with best-effort cancellation.
- Exponential-backoff reconnect for HTTP MCP (5 attempts, 1s → 30s); stdio retries once.
- `${VAR}` / `${VAR:-default}` expansion across MCP command, args, env, url, headers, auth_token.
- `headers_helper` config field: per-server script emits dynamic HTTP headers at connect-time.
- Windows stdio: auto-wrap `npx`, `.cmd`, `.bat`, `.ps1` commands in `cmd /c`.
- Unicode + server-name sanitization of MCP strings; `agsh`, `ide`, `mcp_*` names rejected.
- `sampling/createMessage` server-to-client flow, opt-in via `sampling = true` + `sampling_limit`.
- `roots/list` advertises the agsh current working directory.
- MCP image tool-result content reaches providers as image blocks instead of `[image content]`.
- OAuth callback listener binds to an ephemeral port when `redirect_port` is omitted.
- Ctrl-C now sends `notifications/cancelled` to the server with the in-flight request id.
- Dynamic tool list refresh on `tools/list_changed`: new tools picked up without restart.

### Changed

- `execute_command` names the platform's shell and warns against wrapping PowerShell twice.
- Per-turn `[Permission context]` is a constant two-line block; no longer enumerates blocked tools.
- The tool catalog lists name and permission for active tools, short summaries for deferred.
- System prompt and `body["tools"]` no longer vary with permission; toggles keep the cache warm.
- **Breaking**: an MCP tool with no `readOnlyHint` and no `[mcp].default_permission` needs `Write`.
- MCP tool-result images capped at 10 MiB and restricted to PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP; else a placeholder.
- `read_mcp_resource` total output capped at 10 MiB; oversized chunks replaced with a marker.
- `headers_helper` stdout capped at 64 KiB, stderr at 4 KiB, to contain helper misbehavior.
- JWT signing key files rejected on Unix when group/other perm bits are set (must be 0600).
- `agsh mcp add`/`remove` writes config.toml atomically and chmods it 0600 (dir 0700) on Unix.

### Fixed

- `${VAR}` expansion for MCP config preserves multi-byte UTF-8 (previously corrupted non-ASCII).
- MCP tools with an unserializable input schema are skipped with a warning.
- OAuth-authenticated MCP transports now reconnect cleanly mid-session.
- MCP `sampling/createMessage` has a 60 s provider timeout and refunds the sampling slot on error.
- `agsh mcp remove` now clears that server's entries from the resource-update ledger.
- `agsh mcp remove` now also best-effort revokes stored OAuth tokens at the provider (RFC 7009).
- MCP auth-probe cache with `ttl = 0` now correctly treats every entry as stale.
- rmcp's SSE-reconnect warning floored at `error` by default; CDN idle resets no longer spam.
- MCP cancellation notifications now time out after 2 s so a hung transport can't stall Ctrl-C.
- `agsh mcp add` propagates config-read errors instead of silently treating them as an empty file.

### Security

- MCP progress + elicitation strings sanitized before reaching the terminal; no ANSI/RTL spoofing.
- MCP sampling `system_prompt` stripped of Cc/Cf codepoints before reaching the provider.
- `read_mcp_resource` + `get_mcp_prompt` + list tools sanitize server-supplied text and URIs.
- OAuth revocation rejects redirects, caps metadata at 256 KiB, pins endpoint to issuer origin.
- OAuth callback `error=…` query parameter is stripped of Cc/Cf codepoints before display.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `tests/cli.rs` end-to-end smoke tests for `--version`, `--help`, unknown flags.
- `render::render_error` and `render::render_provider_setup_hint` helpers for CLI output.
- Module-level `//!` doc comments across the codebase; CI runs `cargo doc -D warnings`.
- CI test job runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows to cover platform-specific sandbox code.
- Windows `execute_command` sandbox via Low-integrity token with handle-list inheritance filter.
- Windows sandbox falls back to `CreateProcessWithTokenW` when `SE_INCREASE_QUOTA_NAME` is missing.

### Changed

- Session locking uses OS file locks via `fd-lock` so kernel-released locks survive hard kills.
- `SessionManager::lock_session` is now sync and returns a `SessionLock` RAII handle.
- Schema migration drops the legacy `sessions.locked_by` column to unstick old sessions.
- `execute_command` on Windows invokes PowerShell with `-NoProfile -NonInteractive` always.
- `execute_command` children no longer inherit the agent's stdin; they see immediate EOF.
- Session data dir, lock dir, and DB file are created 0700/0700/0600 on Unix regardless of umask.
- LLM-supplied regex patterns are compiled with 1 MiB size/DFA limits to bound compile-time memory.

### Fixed

- `default_database_path` falls back to `$HOME/.local/share` and errors cleanly when unset.
- Stuck sessions from PID-based locking surviving hard kills (resolved via OS file locks).
- Windows sandbox normal-exit drain now times out after 5s instead of hanging on a grandchild.
- Tool calls with unparseable JSON arguments are now rejected instead of silently run with `{}`.

### Security

- File tools use the canonical path with `O_NOFOLLOW` on Unix, closing a symlink-swap TOCTOU.
- `fetch_url` caps response body at 10 MiB to defend against gzip/brotli decompression bombs.
- Windows Low-integrity sandbox scrubs the child environment so provider API keys aren't inherited.
- On Unix, `execute_command` kills the process group on timeout so no grandchild outlives it.
- Tool indicators strip ANSI CSI escapes and C0 controls, so a command cannot spoof the prompt.
- Permission enforcement now reads the shared permission atomically at the dispatch site.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- `skill` tool for loading named skills.
- YAML frontmatter for skills (description, when_to_use, allowed_tools, version, user_invocable).
- `${AGSH_SKILL_DIR}` and `${AGSH_SESSION_ID}` substitution in skill bodies.
- `[prompt] instructions` config for system-wide instructions injected into every session's prompt.
- `fetch_url` returns a multimodal Image block for image URLs (sandboxed mode, no disk I/O).
- `fetch_url` and `read_file` convert TIFF, ICO, HDR, EXR, TGA, PNM, QOI, DDS, Farbfeld to PNG.
- `render_image` tool views in-memory base64 or scratchpad bytes as a multimodal Image block.

### Changed

- Skills are now directory-based (`~/.config/agsh/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`), not flat files.
- System prompt lists skills by description and when_to_use; agent invokes via `skill` tool.
- `find_files` and `search_contents` descriptions recommend narrow searches, broadening gradually.
- Tool output redirected to scratchpad is never truncated; internal caps are lifted.
- Highlight markdown with `syntect` directly instead of `bat`; reprints are roughly 50x faster.
- Embed Monokai Extended theme from bat for visual parity with the old renderer.
- Drop the `Last message:` banner on session resume; the resuming-session line is sufficient.
- Omit environment info (PWD, date, shell, OS) from prompts in `none` permission mode.

### Fixed

- macOS and Windows CI tests isolate with `AGSH_CONFIG_DIR` rather than the real `config.toml`.
- `cargo doc -D warnings` cleared of broken intra-doc links and bare-URL lints.
- Rename `render_image` input `scratchpad` to `from_scratchpad` so it does not clobber the source.
- Remove redundant 30 KB caps on `execute_command` and `spawn_agent`; oversize handled upstream.
- Show primary param in the tool banner for `skill` and `render_image`.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-04-14

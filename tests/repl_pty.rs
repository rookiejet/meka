//!
//! Everything else in `tests/` runs meka with pipes, which the interactive shell refuses: reedline
//! needs a terminal, and additionally queries the cursor position (DSR, `ESC[6n`) during its first
//! paint, so even `script -qec` fails. That left `run_repl` and everything downstream of it -- the
//! whole `[display]` blank-line contract -- with no automated coverage at all, and a dozen spacing
//! defects accumulated in it unnoticed.
//!
//! This owns the master side of a pty: it answers DSR itself and feeds input whenever the child
//! goes quiet, which is the only "it is at a prompt again" signal available without parsing
//! reedline's paint. The captured bytes are then replayed through the handful of control sequences
//! meka and reedline actually emit, because a raw comparison would be reading carriage returns and
//! erase-to-end-of-line as though they were content.
//!
//! Unix only, and only where the scripted provider (`MEKA_MOCK_PROVIDER`) is compiled in, which a
//! release build does without the `mock-provider` feature.

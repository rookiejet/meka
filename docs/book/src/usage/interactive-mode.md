# Interactive mode

Start meka without `--oneshot` to enter interactive mode:

```bash
meka
```

You get a prompt:

```text
meka ~/project [r] >
```

The path is the session's working directory, shortened with `~`; set [`display.show_path_in_prompt = false`](../configuration/config-file.md#displayshow_path_in_prompt) to drop it. Type your instruction and press **Enter** to submit. The agent processes your request and prints its response (streamed in real time as Markdown). When it finishes, you get another prompt.

## Keybindings

meka uses Emacs-style keybindings (provided by reedline).

### Input

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Enter | Submit the current prompt |
| Alt+Enter, Shift+Enter | Insert a newline (for multi-line input) |
| Shift+Tab | Cycle the permission level, skipping any not in `[permissions].enabled` (by default none &rarr; read &rarr; workspace &rarr; unrestricted &rarr; none) |

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+A | Move cursor to start of line |
| Ctrl+E | Move cursor to end of line |
| Ctrl+F | Move cursor forward one character |
| Ctrl+B | Move cursor backward one character |
| Alt+F | Move cursor forward one word |
| Alt+B | Move cursor backward one word |
| Up / Down | Recall the previous / next input from history |

### Editing

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+D | Delete character under cursor / exit on empty line |
| Ctrl+H, Backspace | Delete character before cursor |
| Ctrl+K | Kill text from cursor to end of line |
| Ctrl+U | Kill text from start of line to cursor |
| Ctrl+W | Kill word before cursor |
| Ctrl+Y | Yank (paste) killed text |

### Control

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+C | Interrupt the running agent (see [Interrupting the agent](#interrupting-the-agent)); clear the line if idle |
| Ctrl+D | Exit the shell (when the line is empty) |
| Ctrl+R | Reverse incremental search through history |
| Ctrl+L | Clear the screen |

### Input history

The prompts you type are saved to the store, so Up / Down and Ctrl+R recall what
you typed in **any previous run**. A brand-new `meka`, a resumed `meka -c`, and the current
session all share one history. Multi-line prompts are preserved intact, and only the most recent
entries are kept (older ones are pruned). This input history is separate from the conversation
shown by `/history`.

## Prompt format

```text
meka <path> [indicator] >
```

The indicator shows the current permission level:

| Level | Indicator | Color |
|------|-----------|-------|
| None | `[n]` | Green |
| Read | `[r]` | Yellow |
| Workspace | `[w]` | Orange |
| Unrestricted | `[u]` | Red |

The color provides a visual cue about the agent's current capabilities. Orange means the agent can modify your system inside the workspace roots; red means it can modify anything you can.

## Multi-line input

Press **Alt+Enter** or **Shift+Enter** to insert a newline instead of submitting. Each continuation line is prefixed with `::: `:

```text
meka ~/project [r] > write a python script that
::: prints hello world
::: and saves it to hello.py
```

Press **Enter** on the last line to submit the entire multi-line input.

Pasting multi-line content also works seamlessly: all pasted lines appear in the buffer for review, and you press **Enter** to submit.

## Slash commands

meka supports `/` prefix commands for controlling the shell. `/help` prints this table, with the
`/mcp` subcommands beneath `/mcp` and the three shortcuts below it. Every slash command writes to
stderr, beside the prompts and notices; the model's answers stay on stdout.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` (or `/?`) | Show this help message |
| `/exit` (or `/quit`) | Exit the shell |
| `/clear` | Clear the terminal screen |
| `/session` | Show the current session id |
| `/title [text]` | Show this session's title, or set it |
| `/permission [none\|read\|workspace\|unrestricted]` | Show or set the permission level |
| `/approvals [on\|off]` | Show or set whether calls above the level are submitted for approval |
| `/profile [name]` | Show or change the profile this session runs on |
| `/compact [instructions]` | Summarize and compact the session, optionally saying what to keep |
| `/rewind [N]` | Drop the last N turns from the conversation (default 1) |
| `/export` | Export the current session as Markdown |
| `/fork` | Fork this session and continue in the copy |
| `/cd [path]` | Change working directory (bare: back to where meka started) |
| `/skill [name] [extra...]` | List skills, or invoke one with extra context |
| `/memory [name]` | List saved memories, or show one by name |
| `/schedule [show <id> \| cancel <id>]` | List this session's scheduled jobs, show one, or cancel one by id |
| `/task [show <id> \| cancel <id\|--all>]` | List background tasks, show one, or cancel one by id |
| `/mcp <subcommand>` | Manage MCP servers and prompts |
| `/mcp list` | List configured MCP servers |
| `/mcp reconnect <server>` | Reconnect smoke-test for one server |
| `/mcp login <server>` | Run the OAuth flow for a server |
| `/mcp logout <server>` | Clear stored credentials for a server |
| `/mcp <server>:<prompt> [args]` | Render an MCP prompt as the next turn |
| `/status` | Show the profile, model, context use and cumulative session stats |
| `/usage` | Show account rate-limit usage (subscription backends) |
| `/history [N]` | Reprint past conversation (bare = all, N = last N turns) |

Some of the grammar the table compresses: a bare `/mcp` is `/mcp list`, and the listing shows each
server's live state (`pending` / `connected` / `failed` / `disabled`); `/task cancel all` is
accepted for `--all`; `/schedule cancel`, `/task cancel` and the two `show`s take an id or any
unique prefix; `/cd ~` still goes home; `/export` writes `session-<id>.md` in the working directory
and prints where it landed; `/skill <name>` prepends anything typed after the name to the skill body;
`/memory` lists memories most important first.

Press **Tab** after typing `/` to open a completion menu of command names, each shown with its description; keep typing to narrow it (`/comp` + Tab completes to `/compact`). Tab also completes arguments: permission levels for `/permission`, `on`/`off` for `/approvals`, configured profile names for
`/profile`, installed skill names for `/skill`, the subcommands and configured servers for `/mcp`, and directory paths for `/cd` (Tab again after a completed directory drills into its subdirectories). The leading command token is colored as you type: green when it names a known command, red when it does not.

### `/history`

Replays prior messages in the current session so you can scroll back through context without exiting and re-resuming. `/history` with no argument dumps every materialized message; `/history 5` shows the last 5 turns (a *turn* = the user's prompt plus everything the agent did to respond). Any non-numeric argument (`/history all`, `/history foo`) falls back to the dump-everything path.

The renderer mimics the live REPL: assistant text flows through the same markdown highlighter, tool calls honor [`display.tool_params`](../configuration/config-file.md#displaytool_params) (by default a one-line `[tool file_read(...)]` indicator), and thinking blocks honor [`[thinking].show_content`](../configuration/config-file.md#thinkingshow_content), rendered by the same renderer the live turn streams into so a replayed block looks like the one you watched arrive. User prompts are prefixed with a cyan `>` so they stand out from agent text.

One difference: a call to a tool from an [MCP server](../configuration/config-file.md#mcpservers) replays as a bare `[tool name]`, without the argument it showed live. Which of a tool's arguments is the one worth showing comes from its JSON Schema, which the server publishes at connect time and the conversation does not store; meka knows its own tools' arguments from their names alone, so those replay in full.

For users who always want extra context at resume time, set [`display.resume_show_recent`](../configuration/config-file.md#displayresume_show_recent); the resume code path then renders the last N turns through the same function.

### `/status`

Print the session's resolved model parameters followed by its cumulative counters:

```
Session status
  Profile:         work
  Account:         anthropic (claude-subscription)
  Model:           claude-opus-4-8
  Context:         128.4k / 1.0M (13% used, 871.6k left)
  Effort:          xhigh
  Thinking:        adaptive
  Turns:           23
  Compactions:     2
  Input tokens:    234.5k  (cache hit: 92%)
  Output tokens:   12.1k
  Redactions:      2 (12 images, ~38.0 MiB freed)
  Messages:        47
```

The top block reports what the session actually resolved to, in the order
[`[profiles.<name>]`](../configuration/config-file.md#accounts-and-profiles) declares the same
fields, so the two can be read side by side: the `Profile` with its account and backend, the `Model`, the
`Context` window, the reasoning `Effort` sent on the wire (omitted when nothing is sent, so the
provider applies its own default; `claude-subscription` sends `high` when the profile sets none),
and the `Thinking` mode. The rest are cumulative counters for the session.

`Context` is the live context-window occupancy: the total tokens of the most recent exchange (all input tiers plus output, i.e. what the next request re-sends minus your new prompt), against the active model's context window, with the percent used and tokens remaining. Use it to decide whether to `/compact` before continuing; after `/compact` it drops to the compacted size immediately. It reflects this session only; sub-agents spawned via `agent_spawn` have their own context and are not counted (a sub-agent's returned result is counted only once it lands in this session as a tool result). It is shown from the start, at `0 / <window>` before the first turn, since the window is your `context_window` setting (or the documented default) and this is where you confirm it took effect; it is omitted only when the window is unknown. Set [`display.show_context_in_prompt`](../configuration/config-file.md#displayshow_context_in_prompt) to show the same gauge in the prompt itself.

`Input tokens` (and the other cumulative counters) is the total billed across every turn of the whole session. These totals are persisted, so resuming a session with `meka -c` continues them rather than restarting at zero.

`Compactions` is how many times the conversation has been summarized, whether automatically, by `/compact` or at the agent's request. It is counted from the session's history, so it survives a resume, and each one puts the earliest detail one more summary away from the original.

`cache hit` is the share of input tokens served from the prompt cache rather than re-sent at full price, on every backend that reports one (Anthropic's cache tiers, OpenAI's `cached_tokens`). It should climb and stay high: meka keeps everything that changes mid-session out of the cached prefix, so a steady session re-reads the cache instead of rewriting it. The figure is arithmetic as much as it is health: every new token (a tool result, the model's own reply) is written to the cache once and read on each later request, so the session-wide share starts at zero, passes 90% around the fifteenth request (each tool call is a request) and keeps climbing from there; a low figure on a short session is not a miss. Expect it to drop once after a `/compact` (which rewrites the head of the conversation) and to recover on the following turns.

`Redactions` reports any times an Anthropic backend had to drop the oldest tool-result image blocks because the request body would have exceeded the profile's `max_request_bytes` (30 MiB by default, held under Anthropic's own 32 MiB limit). A non-zero count indicates the cache prefix was invalidated for the redacted messages. See [`display.show_token_usage`](../configuration/config-file.md#displayshow_token_usage) for a per-turn variant of the same data.

### `/usage`

Fetch the account's current rate-limit usage from the account the session's profile bills and print each rolling window with its percentage used and reset time:

```
Account usage
  5-hour (session)   [#---------]   8% used  (resets in 4h 12m, 2026-07-02 02:10 +02:00)
  Weekly             [----------]   2% used  (resets in 22h 50m, 2026-07-02 13:00 +02:00)
```

This is distinct from `/status`, which reports this session's own token counters. `/usage` queries the upstream service for your whole-account subscription limits. It works only for the backends that expose a usage endpoint: `claude-subscription`, `chatgpt-subscription`, and the three `opencode-go` backends. For an API-key backend it prints a short note that usage is not available there instead. The same command is available under ACP.

### `/compact`

The `/compact` command asks the LLM to summarize the entire conversation, then replaces the messages the model sees with a single summary message followed by the recent tail. This is useful for long sessions that are approaching the context window limit or becoming expensive.

After compacting, the session continues with the summary as context. The pre-compaction messages are never deleted: they stay in the underlying event log on disk (the model just no longer sees them). `meka session export` walks that full log, so an export always contains the entire conversation including the compacted-away turns, with a marker at each compaction point.

### `/rewind`

`/rewind` drops the most recent turn from the conversation, so the model no longer sees it or your prompt that started it. `/rewind N` drops the last `N`. The cut always lands on a turn boundary, so a tool call is never separated from its result. A compaction summary opens a turn of its own, so rewinding past everything after a compaction takes the summary with it and leaves the conversation empty; the turns it replaced stay behind the boundary on disk.

Like `/compact`, nothing is deleted: the dropped turns stay in the event log on disk, and `meka session export` still shows them with a marker where the rewind happened.

Use it to take back a prompt that sent the agent down the wrong path without paying for a summary, or to recover a session the provider has started rejecting. meka repairs a rejection it causes itself (see below), but content that entered the conversation earlier is out of its reach; rewinding past it is the way back. `meka session rewind <id>` does the same to a session you are not currently in.

### Recovering from a rejected message

Providers validate the whole conversation on every request, so one piece of content they reject would otherwise fail every later turn as well, permanently. When that happens, meka strips the offending content from what it added this turn, retries once, and hands the model the provider's own complaint as a failed tool result so it can adapt rather than silently losing the data. If the retry is rejected too, the original content goes back untouched and the turn reports the provider's error.

A mislabeled image already committed to the session is repaired when you resume it, without a provider round trip. For anything further back, use `/rewind`.

### Recovering from a call that got no answer

A refusal is one thing the provider says; a request that never got a usable reply at all is another. A connection that fails or is reset while the request is going out is retried with backoff (up to twice, waiting 1s then 2s), and so is a response body that could not be read back. The turn continues as if the failed attempt had not happened, and nothing about it enters the conversation. Only when the retries run out does the turn report the error.

Worth knowing what a retry can cost. When the failure was a body that could not be read, the provider had already generated the response and billed you for it, so the retry pays a second time. meka does it anyway, because the alternative is losing the turn for content you have already been charged for once, but it is not free.

Two failures are not retried, because the next attempt is known not to be worth making: a request meka could not build, and a URL that redirects in a loop. A redirect loop points at a misconfigured `base_url`; a request that could not be built points at whatever went into it, most often a `base_url` that is not a URL or a stored credential carrying a character that cannot go in a header.

Retrying is bounded by time as well as by count, and the time bound is the one that usually decides. A failure that takes the full idle timeout to arrive costs five minutes, which spends the whole budget, so a stream that hung is reported rather than tried again: retrying is for a failure that was cheap, and a provider that went silent for five minutes has already taken more of your turn than a second silence is worth. Without the bound at all, three slow failures would be fifteen minutes of waiting on a turn that fails anyway.

The bound stops a *new* attempt starting rather than capping the total, so the worst case is a failure arriving just under the five minutes and permitting one more full-length attempt after it, for about ten in total.

### `/fork`

`/fork` copies the current session and switches you into the copy, printing its id. Your conversation carries over untouched, so the branch happens exactly where you are; the original stops there and keeps everything up to that point.

Use it before trying a direction you might want to back out of, or before `/compact` if you'd rather keep the uncompacted conversation around. To go back, exit and resume the original with `meka -r <old-id>`.

The copy is a fully independent session with no link back to its source. (`/fork` only ever runs
against the session you are in, which is never a sub-agent, so the sub-agent case below cannot arise
here.) See [Forking a session](./sessions.md#forking-a-session) for exactly what it carries.

## Shell escape

Prefix any input with `!` to execute it directly as a shell command, bypassing the LLM entirely:

```text
meka ~/projects [r] > !pwd
/home/user/projects
meka ~/projects [r] > !ls -la
total 32
drwxr-xr-x  5 user user 4096 Mar  4 10:00 .
...
meka ~/projects [r] > !ping 1.1.1.1 -c 2
PING 1.1.1.1 (1.1.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
...
```

The command runs with inherited stdin/stdout/stderr, so it behaves exactly like a regular shell. This is useful for quick checks without waiting for the LLM.

## Exiting

You can exit meka in any of these ways:

- Type `/exit` or `/quit`
- Type `exit` or `quit`
- Press **Ctrl+D** on an empty line

## Interrupting the agent

Press **Ctrl+C** while the agent is running to interrupt it. Presses escalate:

1. The first press cancels the current turn: the request in flight is dropped and any shell command the turn spawned is killed. Background tasks keep running, because a keystroke aimed at the answer on screen should not lose a twenty-minute build.
2. A second press during the same turn stops every running background task, records each as canceled, and says how many it stopped.
3. A third press prints `(interrupted)`, gives the canceled work up to two seconds to unwind, and exits with status 130.

The count starts over with each new turn, so the first press of the next turn cancels that turn whatever happened during the last one, and it ends with the turn: a press during a wait that is not a turn (`/usage`, a stuck `/mcp reconnect`) starts a count of its own from the first step. At an idle prompt Ctrl+C clears the line instead.

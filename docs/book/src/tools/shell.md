# Shell tool

## `shell_execute`

Execute a shell command and return its output.

**Permission:** `read` (sandboxed read-only) / `workspace` (sandboxed, writable inside the workspace roots) / `unrestricted` (unsandboxed)

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `command` | string | yes | The shell command to execute |
| `timeout_ms` | integer | no | Timeout in milliseconds (default: 30000) |
| `scratchpad` | string | no | Save output to the scratchpad under this name |

### Behavior

- Executes the command via `sh -c "<command>"` on Unix, or `powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command "<command>"` on Windows, whether or not the command is sandboxed.
- Captures both stdout and stderr.
- Returns the exit code along with the output if non-zero.
- Oversized output is losslessly persisted to the scratchpad by the agent layer; the tool does not truncate what it returns to the agent, up to the residency ceiling below.
- There is no cap on how much a command may print, but there is a cap on how much of it meka holds in memory. Past 8 MiB on one stream the bytes are written to a file instead, and the tool result carries the first and last 32 KiB plus that file's path, so the whole capture stays reachable with `file_read`. The file goes under `MEKA_DATA_DIR/command-output` when that variable is set, else the platform cache directory's `meka` subdirectory, else the temp directory; the temp directory is also the fallback when that directory cannot be created. Captures older than a day are swept on the way past. This exists because a command that writes faster than the turn ends (`cat /dev/zero`, a runaway build log) previously grew one buffer until the process died.
- Default timeout is 30 seconds. If the command exceeds the timeout, it is killed (on Unix, via the process group so backgrounded grandchildren are caught too).
- Supports cancellation: pressing Ctrl+C while a command is running kills the child process.

### Shell-specific semantics

- **Unix (`sh -c`)**: POSIX `$VAR` expansion applies. Pass a literal `$` with single quotes (`'$foo'`) or backslash escape (`\$foo`).
- **Windows (`powershell.exe -Command`)**: The script body reaches PowerShell directly. Use PowerShell syntax (`$var = ...`, `$env:PATH`), and crucially, **do not** wrap your command in another `powershell -Command "..."`. The outer PowerShell will expand your inner `$var` references to empty strings before the inner shell runs, producing a parser error on mangled syntax. If you need to invoke a nested script, drop it into a `.ps1` file and run it by path, use `-EncodedCommand <base64>`, or escape each `$` as `` `$ ``.

### Read-only sandbox

At **`read`**, commands run inside a sandbox that blocks writes to the user's real data. Reads, program execution, and network access still work normally: the threat model is "no state mutation, but `curl http://x | pdftotext` must keep working."

#### What's blocked vs allowed (across all backends)

| Surface | Blocked | Allowed |
|---|---|---|
| Filesystem writes outside tmp / Low-integrity paths | ✓ | |
| Filesystem reads | | ✓ |
| Program execution | | ✓ |
| Outbound network (TCP/UDP) | | ✓ |
| dbus / systemd-user state mutations | Bubblewrap / macOS / Landlock on kernel 7.1+ | Landlock below kernel 7.1 / Windows |
| Mach IPC state mutation (launchd, pasteboard, LaunchServices) | macOS | Linux / Windows |
| COM / RPC to Low-integrity-accepting services (Windows) | | ✓ |
| Inheritance of sensitive parent env vars (API keys, OAuth tokens, …) | ✓ (all platforms) | |

The sandbox is not an adversarial containment boundary; it's defense-in-depth against an agent accidentally modifying user data. Set permission to `none` if you don't trust a turn at all.

#### Scratch space: one place the backends genuinely differ

A confined command may or may not get a writable temporary directory, and this is the one difference between backends big enough to change which commands work:

| Backend | Scratch space | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Bubblewrap (`read`) | Private `/tmp` tmpfs | `mktemp`, `git`, `python`, `gpg`, `pip` all work |
| FreeBSD jailbroker (both levels) | Private `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` tmpfs | `mktemp`, `git`, `python`, `gpg`, `pip` all work |
| Landlock (`read`) | None | Anything that writes a temp file is denied |
| Windows `workspace` | None outside the roots | `New-TemporaryFile` is denied (measured) |
| macOS Seatbelt (`read`) | Per-backend; see below | |

Under Bubblewrap and FreeBSD's jailbroker the child gets a private writable `/tmp`, so `mktemp` succeeds and the write goes nowhere real. Under Landlock there is no such directory and the write is simply denied, which takes `git`'s index lock, Python's `tempfile`, `gpg` and `pip` with it. The same is true of `workspace` on Windows outside the granted roots.

This divergence is deliberate. Granting a scratch directory under Landlock would weaken what `read` promises on the backend that currently keeps that promise strictly, so the narrower behavior stays.

The practical cost is diagnostic: the model sees a bare `Permission denied` naming a path in `/tmp` (or `%TEMP%`), with nothing in the message connecting it to the sandbox, and cannot act on it. If a command fails that way and you expected it to work, install `bwrap` for Landlock hosts, or add the directory it wants as a writable root at `workspace`.

#### Environment variable scrubbing

The `read` sandbox still permits outbound network (the threat model intentionally keeps `curl http://x | pdftotext`-style pipelines working), so any secret in the parent process's environment (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, OAuth tokens, etc.) would be a live exfiltration vector under prompt injection. meka scrubs the child environment at spawn time across every backend (Bubblewrap, Landlock, Seatbelt, Windows Low-integrity).

- **Unix (Linux + macOS): allow-list.** Only a curated set of vars survives into the `read` child: `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `SHELL`, `PWD`, `TERM`, `COLORTERM`, `LANG`, `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, `TEMP`, plus everything matching the `LC_*` and `XDG_*` prefixes. Because `read` intentionally keeps outbound network working, the proxy and CA-bundle vars survive too: `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY` (and their lowercase spellings), `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `SSL_CERT_DIR`, `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, several of which redirect TLS trust, so treat them as part of the boundary. Anything else is dropped, including credential-shaped vars (`AWS_*`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, …) and credential-pointer vars (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `KUBECONFIG`, `GNUPGHOME`, `NETRC`, `GIT_ASKPASS`, `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, etc.) as well as benign-but-unlisted vars like `EDITOR`, `PAGER`, `DISPLAY`, custom toolchain vars, and so on. Unknown vars are dropped by default.
- **Windows: deny-list.** PowerShell pulls in a long tail of system vars (`PSModulePath`, `APPDATA`, `ProgramFiles`, etc.) that don't fit a tidy allow-list, so the Windows path lets everything through *except* names that match a heuristic deny-list. Dropped names include:
    - Credential-shaped substrings: `*TOKEN*`, `*SECRET*`, `*PASSWORD*`, `*PASSPHRASE*`, `*API_KEY*`, `*_KEY*`, `*BEARER*`, `*CREDENTIAL*`, etc.
    - Credential-pointer substrings: `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `KUBECONFIG`, `GNUPGHOME`, `NETRC`, `GIT_ASKPASS`, `SSH_ASKPASS`, `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`.
    - Provider / service prefixes: `ANTHROPIC_*`, `OPENAI_*`, `AWS_*`, `GCP_*`, `GOOGLE_*`, `AZURE_*`, `GITHUB_*`, `OPENROUTER_*`, `GROQ_*`, `MISTRAL_*`, `COHERE_*`, `DATABASE_*`, `POSTGRES_*`, `MONGO_*`, `STRIPE_*`, `CLOUDFLARE_*`, `VAULT_*`, `OAUTH_*`, `JWT_*`, `SENTRY_*`, `SLACK_*`, `DISCORD_*`, and others; see `is_sensitive_env_name` in `src/sandbox.rs` for the full list.

  The deny-list is intentionally aggressive on false positives (a legitimate `GITHUB_ACTOR` is dropped alongside `GITHUB_TOKEN`) because the cost of a missing env var is a confusing tool error, while the cost of a leaked credential is a live exfiltration channel.

**`unrestricted` keeps the full parent environment.** This is the trusted-operation path where users legitimately need `NPM_TOKEN` for `npm publish`, `AWS_*` creds for `aws s3 cp`, `GH_TOKEN` for `gh pr create`, etc. If you need a specific var inside a sandboxed shell command, switch to it for that turn.

An approved command is not an exception: with [approvals](../usage/permissions.md#approvals) on, a command you approve at `read` or `workspace` still runs in that level's sandbox with the scrubbed environment. Approval never widens reach, so the prompt is a question about whether to run the command, not a grant of the environment behind it.

#### Linux: pick a backend

Linux supports two backends, selected via `[shell].sandbox_backend` in `config.toml`:

- **Bubblewrap** (`sandbox_backend = "bubblewrap"`, recommended): wraps the command in `bwrap` with `--ro-bind /`, tmpfs masks over `/run`, `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, and `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, plus `--unshare-user --unshare-pid --unshare-uts --unshare-ipc`. The tmpfs masks make the dbus session bus, systemd-user socket, and other socket-on-disk IPC paths unreachable, so `systemctl --user start <unit>`, `dbus-send`, and similar state-changing calls fail. Network is not unshared. Requires the `bubblewrap` package and a kernel with user-namespace creation enabled.
- **Landlock** (`sandbox_backend = "landlock"`, legacy / fallback): uses the [Landlock LSM](https://landlock.io/). Blocks filesystem writes via `landlock_restrict_self`. **Requires ABI v3 (kernel 6.2+)**: below that the kernel does not mediate `truncate(2)`, so a sandboxed command could still empty an existing file despite every open-for-write being denied. meka reports Landlock unusable on those kernels rather than sandboxing with a ruleset that does not enforce what `read` promises, which means kernels 5.13–6.1 need Bubblewrap installed for the shell at `read`. On kernel 7.1+ (ABI v9) Landlock also blocks `connect()` to every Unix socket on disk, which closes the dbus / systemd-user route out of the sandbox but likewise breaks socket-based clients such as `docker` and `psql` at `read`. **Between ABI v3 and v9 that right does not exist**, so a sandboxed shell can invoke state-mutating dbus methods and `systemd-run --user` escapes the filesystem restriction entirely; meka warns at startup naming exactly which mitigations the running ABI lacks. Prefer Bubblewrap, which removes those sockets on any kernel.

`sandbox_backend` is unset unless you pin it yourself; no command writes it. When unset, meka probes Bubblewrap once at startup and prefers it when available, falling back to Landlock with one warning at startup: that it did so, that Landlock isolates less, and that it cannot hide meka's config and credential store from a sandboxed command. Pinning `sandbox_backend = "landlock"` accepts that and silences the warning.

```toml
[shell]
sandbox = true                       # default; set to false to disable
sandbox_backend = "bubblewrap"       # or "landlock"; unset = auto-detect
```

#### macOS and Windows

- **macOS**: Uses `sandbox-exec` with a hardened SBPL profile (modeled after [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)'s vendored seatbelt policy, which is itself based on Chrome's renderer sandbox). The profile is closed-by-default: filesystem writes are blocked, Mach-lookup is restricted to a curated allow-list of safe services, and mutation paths (launchd job control, pasteboard, LaunchServices, distributed notifications) are not in the allow-list. Network and DNS resolution remain available. The `sandbox_backend` config key is ignored.
- **Windows**: Spawns the child with a duplicated primary token dropped to **Low integrity** (`SECURITY_MANDATORY_LOW_RID`) via `SetTokenInformation(TokenIntegrityLevel, …)`. Writes to the home directory, `%APPDATA%`, Program Files, and system directories (any location with Medium-or-higher integrity ACLs) are blocked by the kernel. Low integrity also strips token privileges, and the same env scrubbing applied on Unix runs here (see [Environment variable scrubbing](#environment-variable-scrubbing) above). The `sandbox_backend` config key is ignored.

Low integrity is not a total write-denial: the child can still write to the small residual Low-integrity-writable surface (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Low`, `%TEMP%\Low`, any path with an explicit Low-integrity write ACE) and to files it creates itself.

#### Windows at `workspace`

`workspace` uses a second mechanism, not the Low-integrity token above. meka derives a capability
SID from each workspace root, places an inheritable `GENERIC_WRITE | DELETE` ACE for it on that
root, and runs the shell under a `WRITE_RESTRICTED` token carrying that capability, so a write
succeeds exactly where one of those ACEs exists. Three consequences worth knowing before you use it:

- meka has to **own** the root, which is what lets it grant without elevation. A network share or
  another user's folder cannot be a workspace root.
- PowerShell runs in **ConstrainedLanguage** mode under a restricted token, so scripts that
  construct .NET types fail there while working at `unrestricted`. meka's UTF-8 output preamble is
  skipped for the same reason, so non-ASCII output may be mangled at `workspace`.
- The ACE is real, standing state on your directory, visible in `icacls`. It is released when the
  process exits, Ctrl+C included, but not after a crash or a kill.

See [Permissions](../usage/permissions.md#per-platform-enforcement) for the full account.

#### When the configured backend is unavailable

If `sandbox_backend = "bubblewrap"` is set but `bwrap` isn't on `$PATH` (or user namespaces are denied), `shell_execute` at `read` returns a hard error rather than silently falling back. The error names the configured backend and the specific failure reason. Either install `bubblewrap`, set `sandbox_backend = "landlock"`, or switch to `unrestricted` (Shift+Tab).

#### FreeBSD

FreeBSD's confinement is not in meka. `jailbrokerd`, a privileged daemon you run, builds a jail per
command and runs it there as your own uid; meka sends it a plan over a Unix socket and reads its
events. The platform has no unprivileged mechanism that refuses a write outside a set of paths that
would fit in a process (Capsicum removes pathname lookup rather than write access, and a jail needs
root and is a separate filesystem tree), so the privileged part lives in one small daemon rather
than in meka.

The only thing to configure here is where that daemon listens:

```toml
[shell]
jailbroker_socket = "/var/run/jailbroker.sock"   # the default
```

`jailbrokerd` and the policy it enforces are set up separately, and that policy is the operator's
rather than meka's: it names which host paths exist in a jail and which of them may be written. What
the two levels mean once it is listening:

- **`read`** runs the command in a jail whose filesystem is the host as that policy admits it, by
  default `/` read-only with any path the policy denies left out. Nothing is mounted read-write.
  Reads are bounded by that mount set, which is the one place this backend is narrower than the
  others: a path outside it is not there. `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` are masked empty and world-writable
  so a command has a scratch directory (a file another tool left in the host's `/tmp` is not visible
  to it), and meka's config directory, data directory and command captures are masked last, exactly
  as they are on the other backends. The host's `/var/run` is left alone, because it holds the
  loader's hint file and a mask over that directory takes everything in it, after which every
  program from packages fails to start. What keeps a command out of the daemon's own socket is the
  daemon's rule, which refuses any request that comes from inside a jail it built.
- **`workspace`** is the same jail plus the session's roots, mounted read-write. A root the policy
  grants only for reading is refused by name rather than mounted read-only, and a denied path
  *inside* a root is cut out of it, so the command can write anywhere in that root except there.
  meka warns when a workspace session comes back with part of a root cut out.

So a `workspace` root has to sit under a path the policy grants for writing, and so does the
session's working directory, which counts as a root because the file tools may write there too. A
policy that grants nothing leaves `read` working everywhere and refuses every `workspace` command;
meka says so at startup. A refusal names the resolved path and the prefix that decided it, and
nothing is created, so the session you get is never narrower than the level you asked for.

meka refuses a socket that is not root-owned under a root-owned chain of directories. The daemon
takes orders from whoever can connect, and every plan carries a command's environment and its write
boundary, so a socket another user could have put there is one whose answers are not the broker's.
If nothing is listening, `read` has no shell at all and `shell_execute` at `read` returns the
reason; `unrestricted` runs a command with no jail, as it does everywhere.

The alternative is to run meka itself inside a jail: every command it spawns is then confined by the
jail's filesystem, network and process view, so `unrestricted` becomes a reasonable level to run at.
The session's roots have to be mounted into the jail at the paths the session uses, meka's config
and data directories have to live inside it, and its store should be treated as the only copy of
anything the agent may write.

#### Disabling the sandbox entirely

To disable sandboxed shell execution altogether, set `sandbox = false` under `[shell]`. When disabled, shell commands require `unrestricted`: `read` loses the tool entirely, and `workspace` refuses it with an error naming the key, because there is no longer anything to hold the boundary that level promises. Reach for `unrestricted` on those turns rather than expecting `workspace` to quietly run unconfined.

```toml
[shell]
sandbox = false
```
